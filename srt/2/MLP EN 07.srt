1
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,795
Who?
Oh, it's you, Owlowiscious.

2
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,336
C'mon, try and keep up!

3
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:40,285
Winona? I mean... Winona's head?!

4
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:43,711
Um, is this weird, or is it just me?

5
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:48,732
Angel?
Gummy?!

6
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:54,021
Okay, this is officially beyond weird now and moved right on down to freaky town.

8
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:55,026
- Alright!
- Aw sweetie!
- Let's get this thing started!

9
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:05,585
Sincerest apologies, Rainbow, if our pets were bothering you.

10
00:02:05,586 --> 00:02:07,535
Say you're sorry, Opal.

11
00:02:08,682 --> 00:02:10,016
She's... sorry.

12
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,139
What are you all doing out here?

13
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:16,439
Why, we always round up our critters for a regular ol' Pony Pet Playdate in this park.

14
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,179
You do?

15
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,179
Same time every week.

16
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:24,229
I thought you knew. You didn't know? She didn't know?

17
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:28,279
Well we had initially planned on inviting Rainbow, of course, except–

18
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:31,689
We were totally gonna invite you, Rainbow, then Twilight remembered that you don't even have a pet.

19
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:34,229
And Rarity remembered that you really like to take naps in the afternoon.

20
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:36,639
Applejack figured you wouldn't be missing out on anything anyway...

21
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,389
And Fluttershy and I nodded our heads in agreement like this.

22
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:42,239
Oh, please don't be mad at us!

23
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,509
Oh, I'm not mad. You all are right.

24
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:49,669
Not much point of a Pony Pet Playdate for me if I'm a pony without a pet, right?

25
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,870
Exactly!

26
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,745
So, if you'll excuse us...

27
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:55,643
Alright! Come on Winona!

28
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:06,883
Hey, now wait a minute!

29
00:03:06,884 --> 00:03:10,900
Just because I don't have a pet NOW, doesn't mean I never want a pet!

30
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:14,581
Oh, really?! You really want a pet? Really?

31
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:17,186
Cause I've got so many wonderful choices at my house!

32
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:20,473
And I know you'll just love them, and they'll love you!

33
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:23,423
And you'll be best friends forever and ever!

34
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,624
Now, Rainbow my dear, I cannot express my delight

35
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,256
It's abundantly clear that somewhere out here

36
00:03:37,257 --> 00:03:39,722
Is a pet that will suit you just right!

37
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:41,755
I can't wait to get started

38
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:44,103
But first let me set a few rules:

39
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:46,496
It's of utmost importance the pet that I get

40
00:03:46,497 --> 00:03:48,913
Is something that's awesome and cool

41
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:50,715
Awesome, cool, got it.

42
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:55,072
I have so many wonderful choices, just wait, you will see

43
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:59,312
I need something real fast like a bullet to keep up with me

44
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,227
Sure! How about a bunny?

45
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:04,779
They're cutesy and wutesy and quick as can be!

46
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,252
Cutesy, wutesy? Have you even met me?

47
00:04:07,453 --> 00:04:08,807
Rainbow have faith

48
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:11,217
You see, I will bet you

49
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:14,172
Somewhere in here is a pet that will get you

50
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:16,088
Come on, the sky's the limit!

51
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,374
Sky is good. I'd like it to fly!

52
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:22,024
Really? Because I think this widdle puddy tat has your name written all over him.

53
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:25,246
Yes he does. Aww, look, he likes you!

54
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:26,964
Pass.

55
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:31,188
I have so many wonderful choices for you to decide

56
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:34,205
There are otters and seals with massive appeal

57
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:36,191
Otters and seals do not fly.

58
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:40,836
Maybe not, but I've seen this particular seal catch ten feet of air when he breaches the water.

59
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,716
That's it. I'm outta here.

60
00:04:44,176 --> 00:04:46,223
Wait! There must be a pet here

61
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:48,804
That will fit the ticket

62
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:51,324
How about a ladybug or a cute cricket?

63
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,048
Bigger! And cooler!

64
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:55,179
Bigger. Cooler. Right.

65
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,980
I've got just the thing in that tree, Dash

66
00:04:57,981 --> 00:05:01,986
Meet your new fabulous pet, Squirrely!

67
00:05:01,987 --> 00:05:03,705
It's just a squirrel.

68
00:05:03,706 --> 00:05:07,070
Not just any squirrel. A flying squirrel!

69
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,593
Yeah... So, like I was saying.

70
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:15,024
Fluttershy, pal, this won't cut it

71
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:18,535
I need a pet to keep up with me!

72
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:22,538
Something awesome, something flying

73
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:26,122
With coolness that defies gravity!

74
00:05:26,123 --> 00:05:28,269
I'm sensing you want an animal that can fly.

75
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,070
You think?

76
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:33,829
I have plenty of wonderful creatures who soar in the sky

77
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,389
Like a sweet hummingbird or a giant monarch butterfly

78
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,585
Better, but cooler!

79
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:43,081
I see. How about an owl, or a wasp, or a toucan?

80
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:46,287
There's so many wonderful creatures the likes of that

81
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,565
There are falcons and eagles

82
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,823
They are both quite regal

83
00:05:51,824 --> 00:05:54,806
Or perhaps what you need is a dark and mysterious bat?

84
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:56,007
Now you're talking!

85
00:05:56,308 --> 00:06:00,007
But instead of just one stand out, now that's too many.

86
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:04,364
So many choices, and such riches a-plenty

87
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:07,008
Not a bad problem to have if you ask me.

88
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:10,340
The bat would be awesome, but the wasp I'm digging too

89
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:13,161
You have something in a yellow striped bat?

90
00:06:13,162 --> 00:06:13,862
No...

91
00:06:13,863 --> 00:06:17,936
I've got a hot pink flamingo, just dying to meet you

92
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:20,737
What to do, what to do?

93
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,001
Of course! That's it! There's really just one way

94
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:28,024
To find out which animal's best

95
00:06:28,553 --> 00:06:32,322
Hold a contest, of speed, agility and guts!

96
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:37,607
That will put each pet to the test!

97
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:39,994
Don't forget style, that should be considered

98
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:41,871
Then we'll know for sure who's best of the leader

99
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:43,292
The one who is awesome and cool

100
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:44,593
Just like me!

101
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:47,192
Can't settle for less, 'cause I'm the best

102
00:06:47,193 --> 00:06:49,026
So a contest we will see!

103
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:51,189
Who's the number one, greatest, perfectest pet

104
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,210
In the world for me!

105
00:06:55,211 --> 00:07:00,306
May the race begin

106
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:03,112
And may the best pet win!

107
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:15,919
So! You all think you've got what it takes to be my pet, do ya?

108
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,448
Well, we'll just see about that!

109
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:25,728
If any of you don't think you can handle it, bow out now before you humiliate yourself in front of your peers.

110
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:32,465
This competition isn't for the weak. You'd better be prepared to step up your game!

111
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:35,129
You call that flapping?!

112
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:36,530
That's better.

113
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:42,726
There's only room on Team Dash for one of you, and my future pet needs to be able to take it to the extreme!

114
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:44,898
Any questions?

115
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:49,512
I got one. Does she understand what a pet really needs?

116
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:53,102
Yeah, like care and attention, love and affection.

117
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:55,710
And breath mints!

118
00:07:56,777 --> 00:08:00,748
Now, you just pay attention, and try your best, and-

119
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:05,162
Seriously, Fluttershy! The turtle? What did you bring that thing here for?

120
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:10,002
Technically he's a tortoise, and he's always dreamed of being somepony's pet.

121
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:14,778
He just wants a chance to compete, he won't get in the way. You won't even know he's here.

122
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:19,789
No.

123
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,367
Oh, just let him try.

124
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:26,470
But there's no way he can possibly keep up. Look at him!

125
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:31,360
- It won't hurt to let him try...
- But--

126
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:33,908
Just let him try?

127
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:37,796
Fine!

128
00:08:38,197 --> 00:08:42,046
But don't say I didn't warn you!
This isn't a game, you know!

129
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:48,540
Alright, now these games will determine which one of you has the most important qualities I'm looking for in a pet.

130
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:50,960
Speed...

131
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:52,615
Agility...

132
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:54,930
Guts...

133
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,110
Style...

134
00:08:58,711 --> 00:08:59,810
Coolness.

135
00:09:00,311 --> 00:09:01,782
Awesomeness.

136
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:04,146
And radicalness.

137
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:06,209
Aren't those all the same thing?

138
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:12,187
You would think that, Twilight. And that's why you would never qualify to be my pet.

139
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:16,634
Speed! On your marks...

140
00:09:18,193 --> 00:09:19,570
Get set...

141
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:29,503
Sorta speedy... not speedy...

142
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:32,219
Pretty speedy... could be more speedy...

143
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,960
Yeah! That's speed!

144
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:47,166
That's just sad.

145
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:49,118
Agility!

146
00:09:51,154 --> 00:09:52,442
Sorta agile...

147
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:55,410
Not agile...

148
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:57,911
Pretty agile...

149
00:09:57,912 --> 00:09:59,404
Could be more agile...

150
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:08,193
Wanna know the opposite of agility? That.

151
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:18,508
Yeah baby, now that's what I call agility!

152
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,571
Don't leave me hanging!

153
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:27,404
I'm gonna have to shave a point off your score for that.

154
00:10:31,937 --> 00:10:37,476
Okay! Which of you has the guts to try and get Opal's favorite toy away from her?

155
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:58,646
Now that takes guts!

156
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:08,668
Style!

157
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:17,005
Any pet of mine's gotta look good, 'cause you gotta make me look good!

158
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:22,115
Coolness!

159
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:23,717
Sorta cool.

160
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:25,564
Not cool.

161
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:27,627
Pretty cool.

162
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,789
Could be cooler.

163
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:32,532
Not what I had in mind.

164
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:36,880
I can't hear you!

165
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:44,520
Now that's a cool sound!

166
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,103
Sorta awesome.

167
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:52,031
Not awesome.

168
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:56,040
Could be more awesome.

169
00:11:57,796 --> 00:12:00,932
Yeah, that is awesome!

170
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,431
You did that already. That's pretty much all you can do, huh?

171
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:32,631
That was truly awesome!

172
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:37,521
But... I'm afraid this is the radicalness competition, so I'm gonna have to take some points off.

173
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,600
- Listen, turtle...
- Tortoise!

174
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,601
Whatever!

175
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:54,573
You've had your fun, but I think you and I both know who made the cut and who didn't.

176
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:01,543
You didn't.

177
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:10,464
I mean... A for effort and everything, you gave it your best shot,

178
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:15,112
maybe I've got a gold star sticker around here somewhere you can have, but, seriously, go home.

179
00:13:15,113 --> 00:13:16,964
You're starting to creep me out.

180
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:23,821
So, anyway...

181
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:29,481
You're all outstanding competitors, but there can only be one of you who's number one.

182
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:34,934
So the final, tie-breaking contest is going to be...

183
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:37,187
Pause for dramatic effect...

184
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:40,511
A race against... me!

185
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:43,437
Through Ghastly Gorge!

186
00:13:46,853 --> 00:13:48,005
Gesundheit.

187
00:13:51,385 --> 00:13:54,903
Actually, Ghastly Gorge isn't scary. It's fun.

188
00:13:55,472 --> 00:14:01,229
I've flown through it a million times myself, so, obviously I'll be at the front of the pack.

189
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:06,784
But whichever of you make it across the finish line with me, will have proven you can keep up with me.

190
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:11,858
And will have earned the honor, and glory, of getting to be my pet!

191
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:12,859
Ready?

192
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:14,680
Set go!

193
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:22,454
Try to keep up!

194
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:40,399
Can't catch me!

195
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:03,418
C'mon, slowpokes! You wanna win, don't ya?

196
00:15:33,237 --> 00:15:37,879
Oh! I forgot to tell you!
Watch out for the Koray eels!

197
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,251
They don't like it when you get too close to their nests... like this!

198
00:16:00,656 --> 00:16:04,417
Easy, peasy, one-two-threesy! Right guys?

199
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:16,365
AVALANCHE!

200
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:36,038
C'mon... no! Wait! Come back! Don't leave me!

201
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:41,353
I'm the one who's supposed to win!
I don't wanna end up stuck here... forever!

202
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,916
Oh no, nonono, this can't be happening.

203
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:51,595
Forever is way too long to be trapped in Ghastly Gorge. I mean, it's like, forever!

204
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:55,400
Somepony! Anypony! Help me!

205
00:17:10,703 --> 00:17:12,481
My prayers have been answered!

206
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:15,365
Oh, thankyouthankyouthank- You?!

207
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:17,679
Oh no!

208
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:24,608
Now I'm not only going to be stuck here forever, I'm gonna be stuck here with the most annoying turtle in the world!

209
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,221
I'm doomed. DOOMED, I tell you!

210
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:58,304
Something's not right here.

211
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:00,699
Where's Rainbow Dash?

212
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:04,746
Great galloping galoshes! There's been an avalanche in there!

213
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:06,147
Rainbow!

214
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:12,011
- Wait! Look! It's the turtle!
- Tortoise!

215
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:13,012
Whatever...

216
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:15,731
And he's carrying something on his back...

217
00:18:15,732 --> 00:18:17,710
It's Rainbow Dash! It's her! It's Rainbow!

218
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:26,294
Maybe we'd better go meet him halfway.

219
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:39,704
Way to go, little guy!

220
00:18:40,005 --> 00:18:42,605
Thank goodness you're not hurt, Rainbow!

221
00:18:42,606 --> 00:18:44,306
Just my pride.

222
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:48,218
I certainly hope all of this dreadful dust was worth it!

223
00:18:49,971 --> 00:18:54,619
It sure was, if it means Rainbow gets to have her own little critter just like the rest of us from now on.

224
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:01,182
Thanks. What you did... I owe you one.

225
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:05,568
Rainbow! Your new pet is over here waiting for you!

226
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,235
Right... yeah. That.

227
00:19:15,636 --> 00:19:16,846
What's the matter?

228
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:18,753
You got your perfect pet, right?

229
00:19:18,754 --> 00:19:21,935
The best of the best like you wanted, remember?

230
00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:25,495
It can fly and it's not a squirrel! Should we sing about it again?

231
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:27,757
A falcon sure looks good on you, Rainbow.

232
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,829
Easy, fella. Nothing to be afraid of.

233
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:42,886
The falcon sure does look cool... he's absolutely everything I wanted in a pet.

234
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:45,696
Yay?

235
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:51,212
But I said whoever crosses the finish line WITH me gets to be my pet.

236
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:55,324
You did! You did say that!
She did say that, that was the rule!

237
00:19:55,325 --> 00:20:02,450
And the only racer who crossed the finish line with me, was the one who stopped to save me when I needed help.

238
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,651
The tortoise!

239
00:20:06,627 --> 00:20:07,867
But what about the--

240
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,183
Would you look at that? He even smiles slow.

241
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,850
Spike, take a letter.

242
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:30,923
Dear Princess Celestia, I used to think that the most important traits to look for in a pet,

243
00:20:30,924 --> 00:20:32,389
or any best friend,

244
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,534
were all physical competitive abilities.

245
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:38,447
But now I can see how short-sighted and shallow that was.

246
00:20:38,648 --> 00:20:44,319
Today I learned what the most important quality really is. A certain kind of spirit.

247
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:52,901
A stick-to-it-iveness. A never give up, can-do attitude that's the mark of a real winner. And this tortoise has it.

248
00:20:52,902 --> 00:20:55,001
- Tenacity.
- Gesundheit.

249
00:20:55,002 --> 00:21:00,463
You just can't stop that little guy.
He's like a... like a... tank!

250
00:21:01,456 --> 00:21:07,004
But Rainbow! You didn't want a pet that couldn't fly because it would keep you grounded and hold you back, remember?

251
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:12,574
Alright c'mon over here Winona!

252
00:21:17,593 --> 00:21:21,994
C'mon, Tank! We're gonna be late for our very first Pony Pet Playdate!
