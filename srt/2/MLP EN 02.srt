1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,340
Princess Celestia! We came
as fast as we could.

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:12,980
I need you to wield the Elements
of Harmony once again and stop Discord.

3
00:00:12,981 --> 00:00:14,837
The Elements! They're gone!

4
00:00:16,753 --> 00:00:19,415
Everypony has to play
or the game is over.

5
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,347
And I win.

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,795
Our friendship... over?

7
00:00:23,796 --> 00:00:24,982
Who were you talking to?

8
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,907
Nopony! Nopony whatsoever.

9
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:28,809
What?

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,714
Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you.

11
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:34,004
WHY? Need a good laugh?

12
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:36,941
What is happening to my friends?

13
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:42,517
Looks like we might be due
for a big old storm of chaos.

14
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:34,124
And what are YOU laughing at?!

15
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:39,092
You ponies are just
the most fun I've had in aeons.

16
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:40,270
Well, QUIT IT!!!

17
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:43,372
You better think
before you laugh at the Pink!

18
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:44,950
...kie Pie!

19
00:01:46,145 --> 00:01:47,485
Oh, yeah?

20
00:01:47,486 --> 00:01:48,904
Well, ha ha.

21
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:49,904
Quit it!

22
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:51,903
No. Ha ha.

23
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,180
QUIT IT!!!

24
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:56,062
No. Ha ha ha ha ha.

25
00:01:56,063 --> 00:01:57,240
Uh, Rarity?

26
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:58,816
This here diamond o' yours?

27
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:02,648
Twilight said we should split it
six way, since we uh...

28
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:03,576
...found it together.

29
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:07,528
Try it, punk. He's mine. All mine!

30
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:10,900
Girls, why are you
all acting like this?

31
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:12,367
We need to stick together!

32
00:02:13,076 --> 00:02:15,436
It's just too entertaining.

33
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,166
Stop it, Discord!
You're not playing fair.

34
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,996
I'm not playing fair?
Perhaps we haven't met.

35
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:26,548
I'm Discord. Spirit of chaos
and disharmony.

36
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:27,860
Hellooo!

37
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,241
How are we supposed to find
the Elements of Harmony...

38
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:33,324
...when you took away the labyrinth
before we could get to the end?!

39
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:34,859
Oh, wait! Did you...?

40
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:36,792
How funny!

41
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,691
You thought the Elements
were *in* the labyrinth?

42
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:47,219
Twists and turns are my master plan...

43
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,612
...then find the Elements
back where you began.

44
00:02:52,656 --> 00:02:55,435
I never said they
were in the labyrinth.

45
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,928
But... But...

46
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:58,917
Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle.

47
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:01,982
♥ Maybe the magic of friendship ♥
can help you.

48
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:05,306
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some chaos to wreak.

49
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,807
Chocolate milk?! I hate chocolate milk!

50
00:03:15,702 --> 00:03:17,214
Think, Twilight, think!

51
00:03:17,215 --> 00:03:19,716
Find the Elements
back where you began...

52
00:03:19,717 --> 00:03:21,481
Back where you began...

53
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:22,993
Don't touch my gem!

54
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:25,917
I'm touching your gem, Rarity. Ha ha.

55
00:03:25,918 --> 00:03:27,266
What's you laughing at?!

56
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:29,812
Ugh, I just wanna go home.

57
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:31,051
Wait a minute...

58
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:34,331
Home! Back where you began!

59
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:36,065
The Elements must be in...

60
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:37,781
...Ponyville!

61
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:41,742
Come on, girls! I'm certain this is
what Discord's riddle really meant.

62
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,442
If we get back to the library...

63
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:46,035
...I have a book that I just know
can give us a clue.

64
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:54,047
Good boy, Angel! Mama's so proud.

65
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:59,601
Weeell, I can see so much better now.

66
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:06,510
I meant to do that.

67
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,881
Discord's turned our
dirt roads into soap!

68
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,112
Beautiful, isn't it?

69
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:19,798
This is the new and improved Ponyville.

70
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,975
And these are only my first changes.

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,009
This may look like fun, but it's not.

72
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:34,283
Picture it, the chaos
capital of the world.

73
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:38,719
I can't picture anything.
It's too dark.

74
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:43,265
Well, wait a few minutes and you'll
see it in the beautiful light of day.

75
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:44,323
Or not.

76
00:04:46,257 --> 00:04:48,962
Ponyville the chaos
capital of the world?

77
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:51,416
Not if I have anything to say about it.

78
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:53,514
Don't worry. You won't.

79
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:05,164
Okay, we're here. Everyone please
please please just go inside, please?

80
00:05:05,165 --> 00:05:07,205
I absolutely refuse.

81
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:08,885
With pleasure.

82
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:13,827
I hate libraries.

83
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:22,540
Pleeease, we gotta hurry!

84
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,418
Forget it, Twilight.
I know what you're up to.

85
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,689
The second I go in you'll have your
little minion Spike come and take Tom.

86
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,677
-Tom?
-Well, it's not going to work!

87
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:37,472
You're not going in
without him, are you?

88
00:05:40,147 --> 00:05:41,086
Fine!

89
00:05:55,173 --> 00:05:57,026
What'd you do that for, Fluttershy?

90
00:05:57,027 --> 00:05:59,106
Cause you just look so peaceful.

91
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:00,279
I, uh...

92
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:03,349
Careful, Twilight!

93
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,425
You'll ruin his beautiful finish.

94
00:06:05,426 --> 00:06:06,812
Oh, for the love of...

95
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:08,270
Twilight, what's going on?

96
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:09,891
Why's everybody look so...

97
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:11,025
...gray?

98
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:14,606
Don't ask. I need you
to help me find something.

99
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:18,023
Hey, Twilight? What's
soaking wet and clueless?

100
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:20,432
Fluttershy, I've had just about enou...

101
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,490
Your face!

102
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:25,836
What's happened to everypony?

103
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:28,380
I guess you just bring up
the worst in us, Spike.

104
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:30,481
No time to explain.

105
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:32,805
We've got to find the reference guide
to Elements of Harmony...

106
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:35,710
...before somepony does
something she'll regret!

107
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,781
The Elements of Harmony?

108
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,976
Oh! I know exactly where that book is!

109
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,759
Found it!

110
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,447
Ha!

111
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:48,033
Fluttershy... You better
give me that book!

112
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,954
Keep away!

113
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:51,191
Hey!

114
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:52,735
Applejack! Give me that book!

115
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:54,175
I don't have any book.

116
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,666
Pinkie!

117
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:58,786
You guys!

118
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:01,712
Stop it right now!

119
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:07,281
Mine!

120
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:09,572
Hey! Do you even know
what you just stole?

121
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:11,944
No, but if you want it, I want it.

122
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,697
GIVE ME THAT BOOK!!!

123
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:25,294
Where is she? Where is Rarity?

124
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:26,236
Beats me.

125
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,600
Lies!

126
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:37,290
Get back! All of you!

127
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,167
This is my book! AND I'M GONNA READ IT!

128
00:07:45,944 --> 00:07:47,356
The Elements!

129
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:57,972
The Elements!

130
00:07:57,973 --> 00:07:59,961
They were here all along!

131
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:00,867
This is great!

132
00:08:00,868 --> 00:08:03,860
Now you guys can defeat Discord
and put everything back to normal.

133
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:07,582
See, girls? We did it! We've found
the Elements of Harmony!

134
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,984
Together!

135
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:12,363
You don't even care, do you?

136
00:08:12,364 --> 00:08:13,323
No.

137
00:08:13,982 --> 00:08:17,266
I never thought it would
happen. My friends...

138
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,784
...have turned into complete jerks!

139
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:23,247
Necklace... Necklace...
Necklace... Necklace...

140
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:24,196
Aaand...

141
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:27,350
...big crown-thingy.
Come on, everypony! Let's go!

142
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:29,998
But, Twilight.
Aren't you missing somepony?

143
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:33,332
Nope. We've got the liar, the grump,
the hoarded and the brute.

144
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,388
That just about covers it.

145
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,324
What about Rainbow Dash?

146
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:40,796
Congratulations, Spike. You're
the new Rainbow Dash. Now let's go!

147
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:42,316
Me?!

148
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:45,198
B-b-but... what if she finds out
I've been impersonating her?

149
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:47,221
That won't end well.

150
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:48,971
Too bad. You're Rainbow Dash.

151
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:52,391
Now let's go defeat Discord so we don't
ever have to talk to each other again.

152
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:54,983
YEAH! WOOHOO!

153
00:08:58,129 --> 00:08:59,151
Move!

154
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:02,645
Look out! Here comes Tom!

155
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:11,211
Well, well, well. I see you've
found the Elements of Harmony.

156
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:13,447
How terrifying!

157
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:16,317
Discord! I've figured out
your lame riddle.

158
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:18,010
You're in for it now!

159
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,348
I certainly am. You've
clearly outduelled me.

160
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:24,853
And now it's time to meet my fate.

161
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:28,045
I'm prepared to be
defeated now, ladies.

162
00:09:28,046 --> 00:09:30,599
Fire when ready.

163
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,697
Formation! Now!

164
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:37,632
Rainbow Dash! Get over here!

165
00:09:39,388 --> 00:09:42,262
All right. Let's get this over with.

166
00:10:03,627 --> 00:10:04,763
What's going on?

167
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:07,681
Mine's workin'. There must be
somethin' wrong with yours.

168
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:10,136
I hate the Elements of Harmony!

169
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,850
Garbage.

170
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:13,723
MINE!

171
00:10:14,002 --> 00:10:17,700
Sorry, Twilight. I guess I better get
back upstairs and clean up the library.

172
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,644
Good luck with all this... whoa!

173
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:23,919
Oops. Sorry, Rainbow Crash.

174
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:28,176
Bravo, ponies! Bravo!

175
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:31,644
Harmony in Equestria
is officially dead.

176
00:10:31,645 --> 00:10:34,414
Discord rules, Celestia drools.

177
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,039
It's your fault it didn't work!

178
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,460
Who are you talking to?

179
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:44,513
Any of you! All of you!

180
00:10:44,514 --> 00:10:45,796
I'm outta here!

181
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:50,329
I better go too. I got new, better
friends waitin' for me at the farm.

182
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:54,338
Yeah! I'm sick of you losers.

183
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:57,099
Fine! Leave! See if I care.

184
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,006
I don't need you guys either.

185
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:01,469
With friends like you, who needs...

186
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,849
...enemies.

187
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:28,872
My stomach!

188
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:33,842
Twilight, you've got to
see what I just did.

189
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:39,770
It's priceless!

190
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:48,276
Come now, Twilight Sparkle. You've
got to get into the spirit of things.

191
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,785
After all, this is your new home.

192
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:56,038
Not anymore.

193
00:11:58,149 --> 00:11:59,703
YES!

194
00:12:07,947 --> 00:12:09,711
Pack your things, Spike. We're leaving.

195
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:15,042
And don't ask where we're going,
'cause... I don't know yet.

196
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:16,500
Just not here.

197
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:20,674
Can't... move!

198
00:12:20,675 --> 00:12:23,327
The Princess...
has been sending these...

199
00:12:24,015 --> 00:12:26,302
...since I came back upstairs.

200
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:31,612
Make it stop!

201
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:33,621
These are all the letters
I've written to the Princess...

202
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:35,591
...since I've lived in Ponyville.

203
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:38,159
But why would she send them back?

204
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,629
"Real friends don't care
what your cover is..."

205
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,057
"Friendship is a wondrous
and powerful thing..."

206
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:48,791
"And like the path cut through the orchard,
there'll be always a way through."

207
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:51,347
"The best thing to do is
to stay true to yourself..."

208
00:12:51,348 --> 00:12:53,708
"...special magical connection
with her friends..."

209
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:55,891
"...maybe even before she's met them."

210
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,155
Spike! Spike, it's all so clear!

211
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:03,925
Can't you see? Discord's trying to
distract us from what's important.

212
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:06,379
He knows how powerful
our friendships are...

213
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,671
...and he's trying to
keep us from seeing it.

214
00:13:09,193 --> 00:13:12,497
Do you remember what I said
the first day we arrived in Ponyville?

215
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:16,321
I told you that the future of Equestria
didn't rest on me making friends.

216
00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:18,228
But the opposite is true!

217
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:19,993
The friendships I've made
since I've been here...

218
00:13:19,994 --> 00:13:22,055
...would save Equestria
from Nightmare Moon.

219
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:24,919
And now they need to
save it from Discord!

220
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:28,073
You're right, Spike.

221
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,122
I've got to fight for my friendships.

222
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:34,127
For them. For me. For Equestria!

223
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:38,410
Oh. Uh...

224
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:41,026
Why don't you just stay here and rest?

225
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:44,272
I'll take care of the whole fighting
for friendship thing myself.

226
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:10,419
And so I tried to defeat Discord...

227
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,471
...but none of my so-called friends
would lift a hoof to help me.

228
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:19,041
Applejack! I'm here to fight
for our friendship.

229
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,429
Oh. Now you wanna fight.

230
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,807
Where were you when
I was battlin' Discord?

231
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:28,822
Snap out of it!

232
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:30,647
This isn't you!

233
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:32,217
You're not a liar.

234
00:14:53,437 --> 00:14:55,697
Wha... What happened?

235
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:57,040
Twilight!

236
00:14:57,604 --> 00:15:00,251
I saw a vision of us
feudin' and fightin'.

237
00:15:00,252 --> 00:15:03,689
I couldn't face the truth
so I started tellin' lies.

238
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,505
Can you ever forgive me?

239
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:07,116
I already have.

240
00:15:07,117 --> 00:15:08,237
Come on!

241
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,640
Oh no!

242
00:15:14,924 --> 00:15:18,358
Twilight! Applejack!
I just had the worst dream!

243
00:15:19,413 --> 00:15:23,342
What do you think you're doing?
Get away from my gem! Get Away!

244
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:30,576
Let us never speak of this again.

245
00:15:34,115 --> 00:15:36,494
Oh, and I... I turned gray!

246
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:38,748
Can you believe it?

247
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:41,888
She's not here.

248
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:44,724
Without Rainbow Dash
we can't use the Elements.

249
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:48,118
She could be anywhere by now.
We're never gonna find her.

250
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:50,254
Yeah, we will. Cause she's right there.

251
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:51,760
Rainbow Dash!

252
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:52,907
Hey, guys!

253
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:55,071
We've been looking everywhere for you.

254
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:56,418
That's nice.

255
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,181
Discord's still on the loose.

256
00:15:58,182 --> 00:16:01,594
We need you to help us defeat him
with your element: loyalty.

257
00:16:02,224 --> 00:16:03,979
Loyalty-schmoyalty.

258
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,235
Have you guys seen Ponyville?
It's a disaster!

259
00:16:07,236 --> 00:16:10,819
I'm staying here in Cloudsdale
where everything is awesome.

260
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,414
How in Equestria could she think that
tiny patch of clouds is Cloudsdale?

261
00:16:15,644 --> 00:16:18,930
The same way he got you to think that
cheap rock was a bona fide diamond?

262
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:21,993
I thought we agreed
never to speak of it again.

263
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:23,851
Time for Plan B.

264
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:32,841
Okay, Fluttershy.

265
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:34,906
You grab Rainbow Dash
and hold her down.

266
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:36,862
Applejack will lower me
down from this rope...

267
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,706
...so I can cast
the memory spell on her.

268
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:39,855
Got it!

269
00:16:45,225 --> 00:16:47,162
Um... I'm just wondering
if it's okay...

270
00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:49,552
...if I hold you down
against your will for a little bit?

271
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:55,246
Nice try. Ponyville's
your problem, not mine.

272
00:16:58,561 --> 00:17:00,852
Come on, Fluttershy!
We've gotta catch her.

273
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:12,228
Applejack!

274
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:24,757
PinkiIEEE! You were supposed
to secure the roOOPE!

275
00:17:24,863 --> 00:17:25,859
Oops.

276
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:31,167
Rarity! Pinkie! Hold on!
Y'all are slowin' 'er down!

277
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:35,166
Oh, Fluttershy. Would you
be a dear and FLY FASTER, please?

278
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:37,430
I can't!

279
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,217
If you can't catch her, Discord wins!

280
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:44,597
That... big... dumb... MEANIE!!!

281
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:51,925
Okay, Applejack! Last rope!
Make it count!

282
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:07,339
Lemme go! I don't need you guys!

283
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,654
Leave me alone!

284
00:18:19,118 --> 00:18:21,264
Wha... What happened?

285
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:23,802
How's Ponyville?!
Where are the Elements?!

286
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:25,704
Did we stop Discord?

287
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,873
Maybe it's a little early
for a group hug.

288
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:50,898
Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing.

289
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:52,842
Not as wonderful...

290
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,863
...as friendship!

291
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,904
This again?

292
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,144
That's right! You couldn't break apart
our friendship for long.

293
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:08,561
Oh, Applejack. Don't lie to me.

294
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,471
I'm the one who made you a liar.

295
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,459
Will you ever learn?

296
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,656
I'll tell you what
we've learned, Discord.

297
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:33,599
We've learned that
friendship isn't always easy...

298
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,344
...but there's no doubt
it's worth fighting for.

299
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:38,129
Ugh, gag.

300
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,864
Fine. Go ahead.
Try and use your little Elements.

301
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:43,202
"Friend me". Just make it quick.

302
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:47,546
I'm missing some excellent chaos here.

303
00:19:47,825 --> 00:19:51,368
All right, ladies! Let's show him
what friendship can do!

304
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,575
Wait, wait, wait!

305
00:20:12,598 --> 00:20:13,435
What's this?

306
00:20:16,246 --> 00:20:17,007
No...

307
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:27,076
Nooo!!!

308
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:16,587
We are gathered here today...

309
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:20,939
...to once again honor
the heroism of these six friends...

310
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,020
...who stood up
to the villain Discord...

311
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:26,730
...and saved Equestria
from eternal chaos.

312
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,640
