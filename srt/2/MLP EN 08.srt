1
00:00:02,476 --> 00:00:05,565
Attention, everypony! Attention!

2
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:08,428
The official Rainbow Dash Fan Club will come to order.

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,163
Let's get right down to our first order of business.

4
00:00:11,164 --> 00:00:16,062
I motion that Rainbow Dash be declared the most awesome pony in Ponyville.

5
00:00:16,063 --> 00:00:21,540
I second the motion, and might I add that if you looked up the word 'awesome' in the dictionary,

6
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,736
there would be a picture of Rainbow Dash.

7
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:26,616
I object!

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,726
I think the word 'awesome' is played out!

9
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:37,329
Rainbow Dash deserves better. I motion that we declare her the most stupendous pony!

10
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,155
'Stupendous'? Is that the best you've got?

11
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:43,870
I motion that we declare her... wonderiffic!

12
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:46,282
- Astonishing!
- Breathtaking!

13
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:49,089
- Astounding!
- Bedazzling!

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,859
What about super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing?

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:02,494
All in favor of declaring Rainbow Dash the most 'super-ultra-extra-ah-whatever-you-said' pony in all of Ponyville, say 'aye'!

16
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:03,495
Aye!

17
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:42,111

18
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:54,795
What a beautiful day.

19
00:01:55,396 --> 00:02:00,134
There's nothing like a dip in the clouds to make a pegasus feel super relaxed.

20
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:02,235
Help! Help!

21
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:05,185
Help! Help!

22
00:02:05,186 --> 00:02:08,267
Looks like my sky swim will have to wait!

23
00:02:10,768 --> 00:02:13,827
I'm Rainbow Dash, and I'm here to rescue you!

24
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,319
What's with this crowd?
Uh, thanks everypony.

25
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,085
It was really no big deal.

26
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:33,096
To me it was! You're my hero, Rainbow Dash!

27
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:41,716
That Rainbow Dash sure is something.

28
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:44,268
Something special.

29
00:03:22,963 --> 00:03:25,546
Oh no! There's something wrong with the baby!

30
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:32,259
She's not cheering for everypony's favorite hero, Rainbow Dash!

31
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:50,740
There just aren't enough words in the dictionary to describe Rainbow Dash's awesomeness.

32
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:52,807
I can think of a few new words.

33
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:55,696
And I bet 'modest' is not one of them.

34
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:03,990
No, but she is kinda awesome.

35
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:19,997
Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow Dash is here!

36
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:34,045
We'd be lost without you!

37
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:36,026
You're our hero, Rainbow Dash!

38
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:38,930
Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash!

39
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:41,544
I can't hear you!

40
00:04:41,545 --> 00:04:51,742
Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!

41
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:56,794
Call me silly, but I think this whole hero thing might be going to Rainbow Dash's head.

42
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:59,184
You may be right, silly.

43
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:07,703
And then, I zoomed into the well. I knew it would be dark and dangerous, but I didn't let that stop me.

44
00:05:07,704 --> 00:05:11,363
Danger's my middle name. Rainbow 'Danger' Dash.

45
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:15,719
Thinking back on it, I acted pretty awesomely heroic that day.

46
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
That day.

47
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:20,802
Awesomely heroic that day and awesomely arrogant ever since.

48
00:05:22,328 --> 00:05:26,271
Hey, Applejack. How would you like to be immortalized as my friend?

49
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:27,372
Immorta what?

50
00:05:30,388 --> 00:05:32,183
Are you taking notes?

51
00:05:32,184 --> 00:05:36,903
Yup! I've been hoof-picked by Rainbow Dash herself, to write her autobiography!

52
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:41,234
Autobiographies are supposed to be written by the pony they are about.

53
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:44,649
Maybe for your normal, run-of-the-mill ponies.

54
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,028
But I'm far too busy saving lives to stop and write.

55
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:50,518
That's why I hired Spike as my ghost writer.

56
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:52,580
Spike's a ghost!

57
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:56,383
Anyway...

58
00:05:56,384 --> 00:06:00,114
Spike here writes down everything I say.
Don't you, Spike?

59
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:03,541
'Don't you Spike...'
Got it!

60
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:09,899
This way, I can stay focused on performing those acts of bravery that nopony else has the guts to perform.

61
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,574
Yep, it takes guts. But it also takes brains.

62
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:15,718
And sometimes a big lunch and a nap.

63
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:21,095
Being a hero is surely not for everypony, but I'm up to the challenge.

64
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,220
There you go.

65
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,940
Someday, I wanna be just like you!

66
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:36,090
Aim high, kid, but don't aim for the impossible.

67
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:41,551
Help! Help!

68
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:44,414
Don't you think you should go and help?

69
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:48,661
Yeah, yeah. I've got a good ten seconds to spare. Just a couple more.

70
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:59,578
The tension is unbearable.
Will Rainbow Dash make it on time?

71
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,347
Holy turnips, that pony came out of nowhere!

72
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:24,433
I've never seen such bravery in all my life!

73
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:28,112
That's right! Ponyville has a new hero.

74
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:32,832
A mysterious mare that has done well by our fair city today.

75
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:38,228
I dub this new masked hero 'The Mysterious Mare-Do-Well'!

76
00:07:40,646 --> 00:07:45,919
'Mare-Do-Well', huh?
Well that mare would do well to stay outta my way!

77
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,779
Ponyville's only got room for one hero, and that hero is me!

78
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:11,046
Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow-

79
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:16,111
Excuse me, do you think you could skip your catchphrase and just hurry up and save us?!

80
00:08:16,686 --> 00:08:18,889
Fine! Picky, picky.

81
00:08:42,157 --> 00:08:44,830
Thank you mare to, well um-

82
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:50,811
I can't believe it.
Mare-Do-Well is stronger than me?

83
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:57,442
Well, a hero is more than just muscle. And she's gonna learn that the hard way.

84
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:25,110
Never fear, your friendly neighborhood whoa!

85
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:32,949
Never fear-

86
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:37,633
I'm coming... hold on.

87
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:38,934
Look!

88
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:06,031
Look out for the-

89
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:07,032
Watch out for falling-

90
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:10,938
On your left! Argh! Your other left!

91
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:15,012
Here you go, safe and sound.

92
00:10:21,324 --> 00:10:25,300
Well, Mare-Do-Well, or should I call you 'Mare-Do-Slow'?

93
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:29,891
You're gonna have to pick up the pace if you wanna compete with me, 'cause I move like lightning.

94
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:34,014
Actually, she saved all of us! We owe her our lives!

95
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:48,242
Okay. She's strong, fast, and somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time.

96
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:50,690
I've gotta step up my game.

97
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,216
If the dam breaks, the whole town will be flooded!

98
00:11:05,217 --> 00:11:07,523
Looks like Ponyville needs a hero!

99
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:11,560
Easy peasy.

100
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:13,824
My game is officially back on.

101
00:11:13,825 --> 00:11:16,545
If only somepony were here to pat me on the back...

102
00:11:16,546 --> 00:11:18,348
Well, I'll do it myself.

103
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:26,413
Heeeelp!

104
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:39,726
You?!

105
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,164
I suppose you want me to thank-

106
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:55,391
You gotta be kidding me.

107
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:08,355
Lemme get this straight.

108
00:12:08,356 --> 00:12:12,254
She's strong, she's agile, and she's magic?

109
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:16,978
How do I compete with that?

110
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:22,356
Wait a minute. I do have a leg up on her.

111
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:24,990
And that leg is... wings!

112
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:29,853
Take that, Mare-Do-Well!

113
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:40,666
Oh, for the love of pete.

114
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:47,872
Gotta hand it to the girl, that Mare-Do-Well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats.

115
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:52,609
I must say I was impressed by that spell she used to fix the dam.

116
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,720
Seems like something like that would take quite a bit of study.

117
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:00,535
She really cares about everypony's safety.

118
00:13:00,536 --> 00:13:06,375
Have you seen her costume? It is to die for! If you ask me she's a hero of fashion.

119
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:08,741
And she's modest and humble.

120
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:12,580
She lets her actions speak for themselves. Gotta admire that.

121
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:16,578
I don't have to admire that! I don't think she's all that great!

122
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,372
- She's... great.
- I didn't say that.

123
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:21,904
Sounds like somepony's jealous.

124
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:23,000
Who, me?

125
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:26,367
- Rainbow Dash is jealous.
- Don't write that, Spike!

126
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,950
Correction: Rainbow Dash is very jealous.

127
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:40,043
Fine! Laugh all you want, but I'll be the one laughing when I prove to you all that I'm just as good-

128
00:13:40,044 --> 00:13:43,578
no, that I'm a better hero than Mare-Do-Well!

129
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,869
No sign of trouble here, darnit.

130
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:58,596
Buses and baby carriages are always careening down this hill.

131
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:01,234
Where is an out-of-control vehicle when you need one?!

132
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,614
There are absolutely no freak natural disasters going on anywhere!

133
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:10,626
How am I supposed to prove myself when everything's so normal and safe?

134
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:15,471
Hold it right there, Granny Smith! You don't have to pretend with me.

135
00:14:15,472 --> 00:14:18,409
I can see that you're in way over your head here.

136
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,380
Eh, what's that?

137
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:25,159
You're putting on a brave face, I get it. But you don't have to anymore.

138
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,102
I'll help you cross the street!

139
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:32,041
Actually I can cross the street just fine!

140
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:38,062
Don't worry! You're in extremely... capable... hooves!

141
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:43,031
Back off!

142
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:49,525
Here we are! Safe and sound.

143
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:54,570
A good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition, don't you think?

144
00:14:56,765 --> 00:15:00,101
I didn't wanna cross the street in the first place!

145
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:07,017
Somepony's in trouble!

146
00:15:10,128 --> 00:15:12,588
You'd better let me handle this, ma'am!

147
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:16,357
For your own safety, I must ask you to stand back!

148
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:17,846
Oh, brother.

149
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:39,761
Ta-dah!

150
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:43,860
Uh... thanks.

151
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:47,853
How would you describe what I just did? Would you say I was amazing?

152
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:49,681
Aren't you milking this a bit?

153
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,547
Please, just answer the question!

154
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:53,503
Was I, or was I not, amazing?

155
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:56,999
- No, you're amazing alright. An amazingly-
- Oh look !

156
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:09,818
Another great feat of heroism! I have just saved that grass!

157
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,178
From what?

158
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:16,112
From weeds!
Weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn!

159
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,911
Lame.

160
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:21,291
Whatever.

161
00:16:23,806 --> 00:16:25,437
Who am I kidding?

162
00:16:33,134 --> 00:16:37,744
All anypony talks about is Mare-Do-Well this, and Mare-Do-Well that!

163
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:42,134
What about me? How could everypony forget about me so easily?

164
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,372
I mean... have I changed?

165
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:51,020
Same sleek body. Same flowing mane. Same spectacular hooves.

166
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:53,205
Nope, I'm still awesome.

167
00:16:53,206 --> 00:16:58,728
They're wrong. But... then... why am I all alone?

168
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,665
I hate being all alone.

169
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,821
- Hey Rainbow Dash!
- I knew it!

170
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:10,960
No need to apologize, squirt. Anypony could make a mistake.

171
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:13,363
Mistake? What mistake?

172
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:17,344
Wait a minute. Why are you here?

173
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:18,811
To invite you to join us.

174
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:23,592
We're heading off to the thank you parade for Ponyville's greatest hero, Mare-Do-Well.

175
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:29,613
No! No way! Can't you see I wanna be alone? I love being alone.

176
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:32,267
Oh, ok. See you later then.

177
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:35,522
Yeah, right, like I'm gonna thank her.

178
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:38,818
Thank you, Mare-Do-Well, whoever you are, for ruining e-

179
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:42,181
Hey squirt! Wait up!

180
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:52,171
Welcome to Ponyville's first, but surely not last, thank you parade, in honor of our city's greatest hero,

181
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:55,814
the mysterious Mare-Do-Well!

182
00:18:02,021 --> 00:18:04,647
The mysterious Mare-Do-Well, huh?

183
00:18:06,027 --> 00:18:11,077
So what are you hiding? Let's see how mysterious you are without that mask!

184
00:18:34,877 --> 00:18:36,253
What the hay?

185
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:58,646
I got you now!

186
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:05,846
Alright, Miss Mysterious! Mystery...

187
00:19:06,726 --> 00:19:08,055
... solved!

188
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:14,101
P-P-P-Pinkie?! What the-th-th-huh?!

189
00:19:20,414 --> 00:19:22,016
Twilight?!

190
00:19:24,438 --> 00:19:26,149
Applejack?!

191
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,982
There were three of you?

192
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:31,442
Yup, we all played Mare-Do-Well at different times.

193
00:19:31,443 --> 00:19:34,231
I stopped the carriage bus with these babies.

194
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:36,751
Bucky McGillygutty and Kicks McGee.

195
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:40,152
I saved the construction workers with my Pinkie Sense.

196
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,762
Sorry!

197
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:46,026
It's alright.

198
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:48,530
And I used my magic to fix the dam.

199
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:51,988
Ooh, ooh! And I did the flyby afterwards.

200
00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:55,808
I made the costumes. Fabulous if I do say so myself.

201
00:19:57,003 --> 00:19:58,831
I don't understand.

202
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,603
Why?

203
00:20:00,604 --> 00:20:02,721
Don't you want me to be a hero?

204
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:05,349
Of course we want you to be a hero.

205
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,093
But a real hero doesn't brag.

206
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:11,166
I guess I did start to brag a little.

207
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,867
A little?!

208
00:20:14,507 --> 00:20:16,263
Okay, a lot.

209
00:20:16,264 --> 00:20:19,809
Celebrating your accomplishments is natural. But...

210
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,694
Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not.

211
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:26,945
Yeah, the only thing that should be rubbed in anypony's face is chocolate cake.

212
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,432
I think we're getting off topic here.

213
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,316
What we're trying to say is, it's great to be really good at something,

214
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:41,327
but it's important to act with grace and humility.

215
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:47,027
That makes loads more sense.

216
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,434
Yeah. You're right.

217
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:54,673
And I guess I should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me.

218
00:20:54,674 --> 00:20:56,894
Like Mare-Do-Well.

219
00:20:57,195 --> 00:21:00,530
Sounds like you've got a letter to write to Princess Celestia.

220
00:21:00,531 --> 00:21:05,139
Already got it covered. As your ghost writer, I've already penned a letter to the Princess.

221
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,663
That's nice of you, Spike, but I really wanna write this letter myself.

222
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:13,428
Come on, I wrote the whole thing already!

223
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:15,539
Okay, let's hear it.

224
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:20,656
- Dear Princess Cel-
- Look out! It's a real ghost!
