1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,717
We're getting closer!

2
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:15,481
I can hardly wait!

3
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:18,991
I'm so excited, I feel like shouting!

4
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:24,355
Canterlot, here we come!

5
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:26,945
I do hope I look festive enough!

6
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:30,062
There it is!
Canterlot!

7
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:38,571
Isn't Canterlot wonderful this time of year?

8
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:42,103
Yeah, I wish it was Hearth's Warming Eve every day.

9
00:00:42,204 --> 00:00:44,282
There's so much to look at...

10
00:00:44,283 --> 00:00:47,374
I feel like my durned eyes are gonna pop right out of my head!

11
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,710
I have an idea, let's play 'I spy with my little eye' as we walk!

12
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:52,051
I'll go first.

13
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,406
I spy... an eight foot candy cane.

14
00:00:55,407 --> 00:00:57,613
I spy a snowpony!

15
00:00:58,763 --> 00:01:01,799
I spy somepony eating a gingerbread house!

16
00:01:04,307 --> 00:01:05,877
And it's me!

17
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:45,474

18
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:03,565
I can't believe that Princess Celestia chose us to put on the most important play of the season!

19
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:05,750
Do you guys know what an honor this is?

20
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,203
For all of us?

21
00:02:07,604 --> 00:02:11,458
I wish she hadn't honored me quite so much... I can't go onstage!

22
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,911
I don't want everypony looking at me!

23
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:17,584
Fluttershy, darling, there's nothing to feel nervous about.

24
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:18,685
No?

25
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:20,751
Of course not.

26
00:02:20,752 --> 00:02:26,367
All across Equestria, ponies are preparing their own pageants for Hearth's Warming Eve, in their own towns.

27
00:02:26,368 --> 00:02:27,568
It's tradition.

28
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:30,837
So you're saying they'll be too busy to come to our play?

29
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:36,770
Well no, we're in the Canterlot pageant, the biggest, most important production in all of Equestria.

30
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:39,413
A lot of ponies will come to watch us.

31
00:02:39,414 --> 00:02:41,491
- A lot?
- Hundreds.

32
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:44,999
- Hundreds?
- Maybe even thousands!

33
00:02:49,153 --> 00:02:51,198
Oh, my hair!

34
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,833
Applejack, be a dear and shut those windows, will you?

35
00:02:55,923 --> 00:03:02,143
Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!
Thank you, thank you!

36
00:03:02,144 --> 00:03:04,904
It's a reenactment of the founding of Equestria.

37
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:07,230
It's not the Rainbow Dash Show.

38
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:11,292
Well it should be the Rainbow Dash Show, I'm the star!

39
00:03:11,293 --> 00:03:14,266
Fluttershy, you've got to come out of there!

40
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:15,816
Curtain in two minutes!

41
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:19,089
- Twilight, let me handle this.
- My hair!

42
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,564
PINKIE!

43
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:26,725
The Hearth's Warming Eve pageant is about harmony and friendship.

44
00:03:26,726 --> 00:03:28,612
Shut the window!

45
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:39,785
Once upon a time, long before the peaceful rule of Celestia,

46
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,331
and before ponies discovered our beautiful land of Equestria,

47
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:45,969
ponies did not know harmony.

48
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,709
It was a strange and dark time.

49
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,287
A time when ponies were torn apart, by hatred.

50
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:55,856
I know. Can you believe it?

51
00:03:55,857 --> 00:04:02,126
During this frightful age, each of the three tribes: the pegasi, the unicorns, and the earth ponies,

52
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:07,212
cared not for what befell the other tribes, but only for their own welfare.

53
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:12,787
In those troubled times, as now, the pegasi were the stewards of the weather.

54
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:15,783
But, they demanded something in return.

55
00:04:15,784 --> 00:04:19,885
Food that could only be grown by the earth ponies.

56
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:28,478
The unicorns demanded the same...

57
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:33,719
...in return for magically bringing forth day and night.

58
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,266
And so, mistrust between the tribes festered,

59
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:41,073
until one fateful day, it came to a boil.

60
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:43,694
And what prompted the ponies to clash?

61
00:04:43,695 --> 00:04:51,132
It was a mysterious blizzard that overtook the land, and toppled the tribes' precarious peace.

62
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,058
The normally industrious earth ponies were unable to farm their land.

63
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,500
The earth ponies were freezing.

64
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:09,226
The home of the pegasi fared no better.

65
00:05:10,662 --> 00:05:12,826
The pegasi were hungry.

66
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:18,476
And the unicorns were freezing and hungry.

67
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:23,651
Even the unicorns' magic was powerless against the storm.

68
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:30,369
Each tribe blamed the others for their suffering.

69
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,937
And the angrier everypony grew, the worse the blizzard became.

70
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:42,634
And so it was decided that a grand summit would be held to figure out a way to cope with the blizzard.

71
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,849
Each tribe sent their leaders.

72
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,415
Daughter of the unicorn king, Princess Platinum.

73
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:55,168
Ruler of the pegasi, Commander Hurricane.

74
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:58,916
And lastly... leader of the earth ponies...

75
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:00,845
Chancellor Puddinghead.

76
00:06:00,846 --> 00:06:04,503
Perhaps the three tribes could finally settle their differences,

77
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:08,119
and agree on a way to get through this disaster.

78
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:17,345
All I wanna know is why the earth ponies are hogging all the food!

79
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:21,764
Us? We're not hogging all the food, you are!

80
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:23,634
Oh wait. You're right. It's us!

81
00:06:23,635 --> 00:06:28,060
Well, it's only 'cause you mean old pegasusususes are making it snow like crazy!

82
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:30,840
For the hundredth time, it's not us!

83
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:34,541
We're not making it snow! It must be the unicorns!

84
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:36,940
They're doing it with their freaky magic!

85
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:44,056
How dare you! Unlike you pegasi ruffians, we unicorns would never stoop to such a thing!

86
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:50,546
Well if you non-earths aren't gonna stop using your weird old powers to freeze us all,

87
00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:52,610
then I'm just plum out of ideas.

88
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:56,307
What a shocker. An earth pony with no ideas.

89
00:06:56,308 --> 00:07:00,327
Commander Hurricane, please cease with the insults!

90
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:03,131
You're not the boss of me, your royal snootiness!

91
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:07,631
I beg your pardon?! I am a princess! I won't be spoken to that way!

92
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,130
I'm leaving first!

93
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:11,631
No, I'm first!

94
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,940
And the blizzard raged on.

95
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:26,817
So the summit of the tribes did not turn out as hoped,

96
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:33,080
and the three leaders returned home to lick their wounds... and basically complain.

97
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:39,325
Atten-tion!

98
00:07:41,864 --> 00:07:44,574
Well? Aren't you curious about how it went?

99
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:47,700
Commander Hurricane, sir! How did it go, sir?

100
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:51,155
Horribly! Those other tribe leaders are so disrespectful!

101
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:55,413
Don't they realize that we are a mighty tribe of warriors, and should not be crossed?

102
00:07:55,414 --> 00:07:58,066
We have got to break ranks from those weak foals!

103
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:05,063
Clover the Clever! I need you!

104
00:08:05,464 --> 00:08:06,956
Yes, your majesty.

105
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:11,859
- Did the other pony tribes see reason as I predicted?
- Those other tribes are impossible!

106
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,700
I, for one, can no longer bear to be anywhere near those lowly creatures.

107
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:19,308
The unicorns are noble, and majestic.

108
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:22,372
We will no longer consort with the likes of them!

109
00:08:29,793 --> 00:08:32,543
Wouldn't it have been easier to use the door, Chancellor?

110
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:36,437
Maybe for you, Smart Cookie. But I am a chancellor.

111
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:39,100
I was elected because I know how to think outside the box.

112
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:43,449
Which means... I can also think inside the chimney.

113
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:46,421
Can you think inside a chimney?

114
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:49,599
I didn't think so.

115
00:08:51,393 --> 00:08:57,607
Oh my gosh. Hold on to your hooves, I am just about to be brilliant!

116
00:08:57,608 --> 00:08:58,790
That'd be a first.

117
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:02,916
I have decided that the earth ponies are gonna go it alone!

118
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,397
So you mean the other tribes didn't come around?

119
00:09:05,398 --> 00:09:09,303
- Shoot. I really thought we could get through to 'em if we--
- Don't worry about them.

120
00:09:09,304 --> 00:09:11,950
We're the ones with all the food, right?

121
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,631
Actually, we're all out.

122
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:18,694
Fine, then we'll have to go somewhere new where we can grow some new food.

123
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:22,563
And with me as our fearless leader, what could go wrong?

124
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,165
Where should I start?

125
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,436
The point is...

126
00:09:27,637 --> 00:09:30,525
We must find a new land!

127
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,149
C'mon, Private Pansy, let's get a move on!
Hup-one, hup-two!

128
00:09:40,348 --> 00:09:42,452
Get a hold of yourself, Private!

129
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:45,480
We cannot let anything distract us from the mission at hand.

130
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:49,570
To find, and if necessary, to conquer a new land!

131
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:51,484
Conquer, sir?

132
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:54,081
You never know where enemies might be lurking.

133
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:58,409
I don't see any enemies, Commander. Just... snow.

134
00:09:58,984 --> 00:10:00,506
What's that?!

135
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:08,407
Okay. This is getting old.

136
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:15,677
This is simply taking forever.
My hooves are killing me!

137
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:17,681
How long have we been walking for?

138
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:19,890
About five minutes, your highness.

139
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:24,042
I never imagined finding a new land would be so hard.

140
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:26,727
But it'll all be worth it.
Don't you agree?

141
00:10:26,728 --> 00:10:29,785
I actually think that the three tribes could've tried harder

142
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:31,852
Stooooop!

143
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:32,953
What's wrong?

144
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:34,770
That is what's wrong!

145
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:42,965
Your highness, it's just a stream.
We can cross it easily.

146
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:44,765
I refuse to get my gown wet.

147
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:48,892
I have no intention of arriving at my new land looking like a bedraggled earth pony.

148
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:51,830
Or worse yet, a rough-and-tumble pegasus.

149
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:55,510
I, for one, have no intention of stooping down to their level.

150
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:59,958
On the other hand, I have no trouble watching you stoop down.

151
00:11:02,415 --> 00:11:06,861
And do watch the gown, darling. It's worth more than all of the books in your library.

152
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:13,108
Yes, yes.

153
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:16,964
This is definitely the right direction.

154
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:18,719
It feels like we're going in circles.

155
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,661
But that's impossible. Are you suggesting I'm reading the map wrong?

156
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:27,532
Absolutely not, your chancellorness, it's just that there are holes in the map, and--

157
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:30,670
Of course! How else could I see where I was going?

158
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:31,671
Yeah...

159
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:34,613
Or talk! I need to be able to talk!

160
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:38,167
I mean, how would we survive if I just suddenly shut up?

161
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:40,917
Heaven forbid that should happen, your chancellorship.

162
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:44,582
It's just that the map is also... upside down.

163
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,597
I got a newsflash for you, Cookie.

164
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:49,057
The earth is round. There is no up or down.

165
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:50,856
You're right!

166
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:54,670
It's such a relief to me that you're in charge of this map...

167
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:58,907
Relief? You don't need relief! If anypony needs relief around here it's me!

168
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:03,385
I'm a chancellor! I'm a bigshot! You're just my, um... my...

169
00:12:03,386 --> 00:12:05,337
- Secretary.
- Whatever!

170
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:10,425
You take the map, while I enjoy some relief.

171
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:12,680
Yes, Chancellor Puddinghead.

172
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:18,685
And so, each leader encountered obstacles along the way.

173
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:23,691
But eventually, they all arrived in a new and wondrous land.

174
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:27,190
Nopony had ever seen paradise before.

175
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:31,003
This is the new land we've been searching for!

176
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:34,976
What a view... I can see my future house from here.

177
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:37,407
I proclaim this new land to be...

178
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:40,445
Pegasopolis!

179
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:43,393
I've never seen such jewels!

180
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:44,953
This ruby is dazzling.

181
00:12:44,954 --> 00:12:49,047
This whole land is dazzling. I'm double dazzled!

182
00:12:49,748 --> 00:12:54,715
In the name of the unicorns, I hereby dub this land Unicornia!

183
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:58,131
The air! The trees!

184
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:03,766
The dirt. This dirt is the dirtiest dirt in the whole dirt world!

185
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:06,245
And fertile, too. Perfect for growing food.

186
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:10,708
In the name of the earth ponies, I think I'm gonna call this new place...

187
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:13,084
Dirtville!

188
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,051
How about 'Earth'?

189
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:20,613
Earth!
Congratulations to me for thinking of it.

190
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:25,060
We found our new home!

191
00:13:30,764 --> 00:13:32,639
I planted my flag first!

192
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,676
- Did not!
- Did too!

193
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:37,446
I planted mine earlier than first.

194
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:40,629
All of you riff-raff are trespassing in Unicornia!

195
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,455
- The name is Pegasopolis!
- Earth!

196
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:46,103
- Pegasopolis!
- Unicornia!

197
00:13:46,104 --> 00:13:49,749
I say we fight for the land.
May the best pony win!

198
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,605
That's barbaric. Clover the Clever?
Throw that brute into the dungeon!

199
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:59,481
What dungeon? Look, perhaps if we all calmed down...

200
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:02,135
I agree. Let's all calm down.

201
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:03,904
I vote for calm.

202
00:14:03,905 --> 00:14:07,692
I'll have you court-martialled for insubordination, Private!

203
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:10,358
We settle this on the battlefield!

204
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:18,641
Who dares throw a snowball at royalty?!

205
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:22,278
Wait a minute, where'd all this snow come from anyway?

206
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,191
Oh no. Not again.

207
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,497
And so the paradise that the ponies had found was soon lost.

208
00:14:36,498 --> 00:14:40,592
Buried beneath a blanket of snow, and hard feelings.

209
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:46,650
Instead of beautiful, it was blizzardy.
Instead of wonderful, it was wintry!

210
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:50,253
Instead of spectacular, it was snow-tacular!
Instead of--

211
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:52,696
We get it! Move on!

212
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:56,831
Everypony was forced to seek shelter.

213
00:14:56,832 --> 00:15:03,957
They searched high and low, but the only shelter for miles was a cold and desolate cave.

214
00:15:04,258 --> 00:15:11,372
And, of course, the three tribes had to share it, and nopony was too happy about that.

215
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:14,050
Please, Commander Hothead.

216
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:16,243
It's Commander Hurricane.

217
00:15:17,158 --> 00:15:22,147
Please, Commander, could you just stand back and give me my royal space?

218
00:15:22,148 --> 00:15:24,365
You mean like this, your highness?

219
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:28,027
Indeed not! You see this invisible line?

220
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:31,942
Private? Outline our territory for everypony to see.

221
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,650
See this real, non-invisible line?

222
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:40,271
No unicorns or earth ponies are allowed to cross it!

223
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,870
This is the sovereign territory of Pegasopolis!

224
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,831
- Clover the Clever?
- Smart Cookie!

225
00:15:46,832 --> 00:15:48,232
I know, I know.

226
00:15:56,237 --> 00:15:59,468
What are you doing? Don't go around the rock, go over it!

227
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:01,826
I'm not giving up an inch of territory to the enemy!

228
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,872
That rock is clearly on the Unicornia side of the cave, and it belongs to us!

229
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:08,403
Who knows, there could be jewels inside.

230
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,283
I claim this rock for Pegasopolis!

231
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:15,712
Unhand that rock this instant, you scoundrel!

232
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:19,589
Oh look, you found my rock. I've been looking for it everywhere.

233
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:26,024
- Hey! You invaded our territory!
- Finders keepers, losers weepers!

234
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:28,070
That's the last straw!

235
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:32,298
Give me my rock!

236
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:47,889
Look, everypony! The entrance!

237
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,039
Great. Now there's no way out! We're trapped!

238
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,009
You two deserve this horrible fate, you've done nothing but argue and fight with each other!

239
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,132
You've been fighting too, your highness.

240
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:06,332
Yeah! Worse! I haven't been fighting nearly as much as you!

241
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,386
How ridiculous! A unicorn never stoops to fighting!

242
00:17:09,387 --> 00:17:12,654
That's just 'cause you wimpy unicorns know you never win!

243
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:15,467
Earth ponies are numbskulls!

244
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,219
Pegasi are brutes!

245
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,622
Unicorns are snobs!

246
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:38,830
What is that... thing?

247
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:41,337
They must be... Windigos!

248
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:43,603
Windigos?

249
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,828
My mentor Starswirl the Bearded taught me about them.

250
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:50,123
They're winter spirits that feed off fighting and hatred.

251
00:17:50,124 --> 00:17:53,949
The more hate the spirit feels, the colder things become!

252
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,562
Then... this is our fault.

253
00:17:56,563 --> 00:18:02,945
We three tribes... we brought this blizzard to our home by fightin' and not trustin' each other.

254
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:05,381
Now it's destroyin' this land, too.

255
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:09,213
And now our bodies will become as cold as our hearts...

256
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:12,148
all because we were foolish enough to hate.

257
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:15,441
Well, I don't hate you...

258
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:19,594
I actually hate Commander Hurricane a lot more than I hate you guys.

259
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:31,225
Actually, I don't really hate her, I just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really dislike her.

260
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:37,711
- Well, I don't hate you guys either.
- Nor do I!

261
00:18:39,741 --> 00:18:43,349
No matter what our differences, we're all ponies.

262
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:05,376
What was that?

263
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,419
- I didn't know unicorns could do that.
- I didn't either.

264
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,655
Nothing like this has ever happened before.

265
00:19:10,656 --> 00:19:17,244
But I know it couldn't have been just me, it came from all three of us, joined together, in friendship.

266
00:19:18,018 --> 00:19:24,990
All through the night, the three ponies kept the fire of friendship alive by telling stories to one another and by singing songs...

267
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:30,052
Which of course became the winter carols that we all still sing today.

268
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:34,837
Eventually the warmth of the fire and singing and laughing reached the leaders,

269
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:37,562
and their bodies began to thaw.

270
00:19:38,466 --> 00:19:42,052
And, it even began to melt their hearts.

271
00:19:54,949 --> 00:20:01,098
The three leaders agreed to share the beautiful land, and live in harmony ever afterwards.

272
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,122
And together, they named their new land...

273
00:20:04,123 --> 00:20:06,083
Equestria!

274
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:24,273
The fire of friendship lives in our hearts

275
00:20:24,274 --> 00:20:28,426
As long as it burns we cannot drift apart

276
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:32,634
Though quarrels arise, their numbers are few

277
00:20:32,635 --> 00:20:38,609
Laughter and singing will see us through
(Will see us through)

278
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,257
We are a circle of pony friends

279
00:20:42,258 --> 00:20:51,152
A circle of friends we'll be to the very end

280
00:20:55,899 --> 00:20:59,812
We should be so honored that Princess Celestia chose us!

281
00:20:59,813 --> 00:21:03,925
She must really think we exemplify what good friends are!

282
00:21:05,313 --> 00:21:08,639
Applejack, I thought you closed all the windows.

283
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,477
Don't blame me.
Rainbow Dash should've flown up there and shut it.

284
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,077
After all, she's got wings!

285
00:21:13,078 --> 00:21:15,508
Why do I always have to do the high up chores?

286
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:18,236
Why can't Twilight use her magic for a change!

287
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:25,206
You know what? I got it.
