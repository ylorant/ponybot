1
00:00:11,757 --> 00:00:18,796
The timber wolves are a-howlin'!
The timber wolves are a-howlin'!

2
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:21,873
Eyup.

3
00:00:22,074 --> 00:00:25,958
The Zap Apples are comin'!
The Zap Apples are comin'!

4
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:29,541
Yay, the Zap Apples are comin'!

5
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:31,142
That's what I said.

00:01:10,382 --> 00:01:14,356
Hey, silly goose!
Quit your gawkin' and move your caboose!

8
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:23,267
Ready, Granny!

9
00:01:24,174 --> 00:01:27,571
- Ready for what?
- For makin' Zap Apple Jam!

10
00:01:27,572 --> 00:01:33,096
Darn tootin'! It's time for some good
old-fashioned Zap Apple Jammin'!

11
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:34,979
Yes mam, I can't wait mam!

12
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:38,537
Wait for what?

13
00:01:38,538 --> 00:01:40,675
To make Zap Apple Jam with you!

14
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:41,676
Of course!

15
00:01:41,677 --> 00:01:45,011
Now I been doing this ever
since I was a little pony.

16
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:49,067
So be warned, pickle pear,
there's a whole mess steps in this process

17
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,465
and you got to get each one of them just right...

18
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:54,266
...or no Zap Apple Jam.

19
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:55,667
Take this.

20
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:59,679
Is this one of your gazillion secret herbal
ingredients for the Zap Apple Jam?

21
00:02:00,723 --> 00:02:04,026
That there's a broom.
Now get sweepin', pipsqueak!

22
00:02:04,427 --> 00:02:07,595
Now while you sweep, I'll get to...

23
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:11,437
Oh ponyfeathers!

24
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:14,518
Bet I'd forget my mane if it
wasn't attached to my head.

25
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:37,534
There's the Zap Apple leaves!
Right on schedule!

26
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:49,003
(Granny Smith sings the ABC's)

27
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,746
Well, howdy-doo there, Filthy Rich!

28
00:02:55,747 --> 00:03:01,451
Hello, Mrs. Smith, did I hear right that there's
a Zap Apple harvest coming in a few days?

29
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:03,878
Four days, to be exact.

30
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,118
Excellent news!

31
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:08,284
And as usual, I get your first hundred jars?

32
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:09,885
'Course, Filthy.

33
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:11,706
I prefer Rich?

34
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:17,250
Oh, you poor, poor thing...

35
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:20,677
...having to make all that
Zap Apple Jam with Granny Smith.

36
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:26,965
Actually, I been looking forward to
making Zap Apple Jam for years!

37
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:31,052
I'm not talking about the jam,
I'm talking about Granny Smith!

38
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:34,338
You must be sooo embarassed.

39
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:37,719
What do ya mean?

40
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,173
You know, with all her silly ways,
how she forgets things...

41
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:45,240
...and makes you wear these
ridiculous costumes?

42
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:47,071
Granny said that the water needs-

43
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:52,219
Thank goodness you're here on the farm and
not in town where everypony could see you.

44
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,184
Don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.

45
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,484
"Silly ways"?

46
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:01,525
Thank you kindly, Filthy!

47
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:06,719
Shake a leg there, slowpoke!

48
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,111
We got a gaggle's worth of goods
to gather before the harvest.

49
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,312
Come on!

50
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:16,417
Gonna make Zap Apple Jam, oopsie ooh!
Gatherin' the goodies now, oopdie hee!

51
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:21,800
Singin' and dancin', diddleye ooh, flippity floo my darlin'!

52
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:26,338
They don't make 'em like they used to.

53
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:32,609
Hey, you bite it, you buy it!

54
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:51,664
Why hello bees, Beatrice, Beecher!
You've all been busy little bees, haven't you?

55
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:58,951
Granny, isn't there a less
silly way to get the honey?

56
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:06,424
Isn't this just precious?

57
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:07,425
Please stop!

58
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:11,776
And it is perfect for makin'
our Zap Apple Jam!

59
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:14,071
Stop it, Granny!

60
00:05:14,872 --> 00:05:18,785
Granny, please!
Those ponies over there are watchin' me!

61
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:22,235
What?
Are those fillies your friends?

62
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:24,927
Hello, Half-pint's friends!

63
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:29,994
Hi, Granny Smith!
Hi, Half-pint!

64
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,887
What dolls.

65
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:38,018
Why, when I was little,
ponies didn't come that purdy.

66
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,524
Are we done shopping, Granny?

67
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:41,819
'Cause I'd like to get back to the farm, fast.

68
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,497
Hold on, snellybelly.

69
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:47,932
I got my honey, gooey-goo!
Got my honey, gooey-ooh!

70
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:50,203
Got my honey, iddley-hoo!

71
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:57,684
And by capturing the whole sale market,
purchasing in bulk and slashing all prices

72
00:05:57,685 --> 00:06:01,048
we undermine every other gift market in town.

73
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:07,298
And that's how Rich's Barnyard Bargains
became the cornerstone of retail in Ponyville.

74
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:13,799
Well, thank you, Mr. Filthy- I mean, Mr. Rich...

75
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,002
...what a wonderful day of sharing!

76
00:06:16,003 --> 00:06:19,815
And thank you for being a part of
Family Appreciation Day!

77
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,607
Now, let's see who will be bringing in a family member

78
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:26,810
for next Monday's Family Appreciation Day...

79
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,978
Oh! Apple Bloom!

80
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,944
But Miss Cheerilee,
Monday is Zap Apple harvest day!

81
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:36,692
And Applejack and Big Macintosh
will be too busy to come and speak.

82
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:39,872
Well, is there anypony else
in your family that could-

83
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:44,987
Miss Cheerilee! Apple Bloom's Granny Smith
isn't working harvest...

84
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,132
...she could come.

85
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,585
Oh!
But, uh, no, that wouldn't-

86
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:52,598
That's a splendid idea, Diamond Tiara!

87
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:56,270
Apple Bloom, you shall bring in
Granny Smith on Monday.

88
00:06:57,446 --> 00:06:59,637
Have a great weekend, everypony!

89
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:04,352
Granny Smith?
Come Monday?

90
00:07:04,353 --> 00:07:07,649
I'll be the laughing stock of Ponyville!

91
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:18,049
I'm sorry, Apple Bloom,
I already told you that

92
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,859
we just can't take a break from
harvest to come to your school.

93
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,538
You know what'll happen.

94
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:27,334
I know... after the fifth day,
the Zap Apples disappear...

95
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:41,392
Look! The third sign!

96
00:07:42,034 --> 00:07:43,544
Right on time!

97
00:07:43,845 --> 00:07:45,770
Hot diggity!

98
00:07:57,984 --> 00:08:01,525
Alright, you lazy daisies,
cool your caboose!

99
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:05,755
I'm sorry, Apple Bloom,
but don't you fret.

100
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:09,389
Granny Smith's got no shortage
of entertainin' stories to tell.

101
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,624
I know.
That's what I'm worried about...

102
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:21,964
I'll be embarrassed, shamed,
disgraced, mortified, humiliate-

103
00:08:22,342 --> 00:08:24,396
What are you, a dictionary?

104
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:27,073
Snap out of it,
we're here to help you!

105
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,985
After all, we are the
Cutie Mark Crusaders.

106
00:08:29,986 --> 00:08:32,689
We'll figure out a way to
postpone your presentation.

107
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,019
But how?

108
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,111
All this worry is makin' me sick!

109
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,109
Sick?

110
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:45,438
That's it!
C'mon!

111
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,616
Ten-hut!

112
00:08:50,117 --> 00:08:52,033
Now listen here, troops!

113
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:57,183
I don't want any whinin', or cryin',
or crackin' under pressure!

114
00:08:57,184 --> 00:08:59,328
Do I make myself clear?

115
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,485
Court-martial!

116
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:11,204
Stay still, Apple Bloom!
You have to look sick!

117
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:17,837
Hey, this is hot!

118
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:21,576
What in the hayseed is going on
in there, silly billy?

119
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:28,213
Oh, Granny Smith! We were
just about to come get you!

120
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:29,708
Apple Bloom's sick!

121
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:33,468
Looks like she may have
to stay home all week!

122
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:40,889
Perfect as a Piccadilly pear!

123
00:09:41,702 --> 00:09:43,346
Now what?

124
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:47,479
It's already almost sundown!

125
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,553
Tomorrow is Sunday and I only have
one more day to figure something out!

126
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:53,435
Hey!
Look!

127
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:59,561
That's the fourth sign!

128
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:13,785
The Zap Apples have appeared!

129
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:16,514
And that gives me an idea!

130
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:28,487
We can't move Family Appreciation Day,
so let's move harvest day instead!

131
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:31,538
They don't look... quite ripe.

132
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:34,026
Harvesting apples early
never hurt an apple.

133
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:38,538
I don't know... Zap Apple trees
aren't like normal apple trees.

134
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:39,539
They're magic.

135
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,261
How different can they be?

136
00:10:48,837 --> 00:10:51,909
Well if we can't buck 'em,
let's just pick 'em!

137
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,008
Any other bright ideas?

138
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:18,215
Granny Smith, it's Miss Cheerilee!

139
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:20,617
Apple Bloom said you
wanted to speak with me?

140
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,928
Hello?
Granny Smi-

141
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,892
Well hello there!
Howdydoo!

142
00:11:31,393 --> 00:11:35,814
Hi... Granny Smith...
is everything okay?

143
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:38,854
Of course it is!
Why wouldn't it be?

144
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:50,318
Excuse me, pickles always
give me the hiccups!

145
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:59,039
I need to tell you that I can't make
the presentation on Monday after all!

146
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,732
Oh no, is that so?

147
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:03,487
No doubts about it!

148
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:07,066
I gotta shear the flowers
and water the sheep!

149
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:11,335
I mean, I have to water the flowers
and shear the sheep!

150
00:12:12,236 --> 00:12:15,442
That's too bad.
We can reschedule.

151
00:12:18,246 --> 00:12:19,533
Where am I?

152
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:25,826
Well howdy, Miss Cheerilee!
You window shopping?

153
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:31,288
No, you asked me to come
here to tell me that you

154
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:34,370
wouldn't be making it to
Family Appreciation Day?

155
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:39,445
Fiddlesticks! I wouldn't miss it
for all the tea in Canterlot!

156
00:12:39,446 --> 00:12:42,914
- But, didn't you just say...
- See you Monday!

157
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:52,620
I can't believe she woke up from her nap.

158
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:55,714
She never wakes up from her nap!

159
00:12:55,715 --> 00:12:58,903
I wish I could just run off and hide!

160
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:05,838
Well you can't run off...
but maybe somepony else can!

161
00:13:30,836 --> 00:13:34,201
The Zap Apple harvest has begun!

162
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:40,006
And tomorrow we'll be making up
some Zap Apple Jam!

163
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:43,707
Miss Granny Smith?
Telegram.

164
00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:47,675
Well, bust my buttons.

165
00:13:47,676 --> 00:13:51,088
Uncle Apple Strudel wants me to pay him a visit.

166
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,259
And you can just make the 8am train.

167
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,943
I already packed you a bag!

168
00:13:54,944 --> 00:13:56,784
Well that was considerate.

169
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:59,111
But don't you worry, flibbertigibbet!

170
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:01,949
I'll be back in time to make that jam!

171
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:07,310
That train ride takes all day.
I'm safe.

172
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:10,734
For today's Family Appreciation Day

173
00:14:10,735 --> 00:14:13,624
we are pleased to welcome Granny Smith.

174
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:18,814
Apple Bloom?
Is Granny Smith here?

175
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:23,175
I'm sorry, Miss Cheerilee,
but she got called out of town

176
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:25,975
on account of a family emergency...

177
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:29,071
Well howdy, my little ponies!

178
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:40,076
Howdy, y'all! I'm as happy as a pig
in a fresh mudpile to be here!

179
00:14:41,177 --> 00:14:45,487
What are you doing here?
Did you miss the train?

180
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:50,794
No, it came.
And Uncle Apple Strudel was on it.

181
00:14:50,795 --> 00:14:53,937
Ooooooh, noogie noogie noggie!

182
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:58,958
I can't wait to hear
Granny Smith's presentation...

183
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,788
...if she can remember any of it.

184
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:08,643
Long ago, when I was a little pony...

185
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:13,084
...things were very different here in Ponyville...

186
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:18,006
...'cause there was no Ponyville!

187
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:21,164
That's right, my little ponies.

188
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:23,974
Me and my family were pilgrim pony folk

189
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:26,018
back when I was a little filly.

190
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:28,354
We ventured far and wide

191
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:30,644
collecting new seeds and sellin' them on.

192
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:35,275
But my pa was the finest seed collector in all of Equestria.

193
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:40,126
Then, one day, the Smith family
found themselves in the most brilliant,

194
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:43,695
most grand, most magnificent of all cities.

195
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:48,028
A place called... Canterlot.

196
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:50,094
Why, I bet your hooves to hindquarters that

197
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:53,291
I had never seen anything like it before nor since.

198
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:59,265
And as if the beauty of that city
wasn't enough, suddenly, she appeared...

199
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:03,824
Princess Celestia, the most regal of all ponies.

200
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:09,406
When lo and behold, she stopped and
look at my pa's seed collection.

201
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:13,319
Then Princess Celestia saw that
we were plumb-tuckered

202
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,584
and hankerin' to find our forever home.

203
00:16:15,585 --> 00:16:18,066
And bein' a royal Princess and all,

204
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:22,209
she knew exactly the place for us
to lay down our stakes.

205
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,236
My pa gave the Princess a mighty thanks.

206
00:16:26,926 --> 00:16:29,891
We quickly found that land near the Everfree Forest

207
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:31,866
and we built our first home.

208
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:34,831
Next, we planted our first orchards.

209
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:37,689
But an orchard don't grow overnight...

210
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,296
and we were getting mighty short on food.

211
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:46,380
Now mind you, we were
cautioned about the forest

212
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,552
and we knew that it was not fit to enter.

213
00:16:50,255 --> 00:16:52,795
But I knew there was critters livin' there

214
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:54,933
so there must be somethin' to eat.

215
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:56,974
It was dark and musty

216
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,736
and I won't lie, it was scary.

217
00:16:59,737 --> 00:17:02,697
But every inch was covered in plant life.

218
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:04,906
And before I knew it wasn't I standin'

219
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:07,497
in front of the most incredible...

220
00:17:07,498 --> 00:17:10,232
...apple trees!

221
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:14,804
I had never seen anything before
this kind of colorful fruit!

222
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,818
I started picking apples quick as a whip!

223
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:32,329
I turned, and there before me stood...

224
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,394
...the timber wolves!

225
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:39,673
I'd never run so fast in my life.

226
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:43,325
I did the only thing I could think of...

227
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:59,601
My pa and I planted those special apple seeds

228
00:17:59,602 --> 00:18:02,551
and before our eyes they grew like wildfire.

229
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,494
Well, we had full grown trees faster
than you could say lickety split.

230
00:18:10,063 --> 00:18:12,571
Then each year, I paid close attention to

231
00:18:12,572 --> 00:18:15,662
the signs of the Zap Apple special harvesting times.

232
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:18,065
How the weather affects the Everfree Forest

233
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:22,224
how the timber wolves howl when
the Zap Apples first start growing

234
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:26,051
and how they zapped away if
you didn't pick 'em all in one day!

235
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:30,281
And the fruits of our labor were
the best fruit we ever tasted.

236
00:18:30,282 --> 00:18:34,100
Soon enough I was mixing up batches of Zap Apple Jam.

237
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:37,443
Just like harvestin' the Zap Apples had its special rules

238
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:39,932
so did makin' Zap Apple Jam!

239
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:43,434
I learned that you gotta be extra friendly with the bees

240
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:45,996
otherwise their honey won't taste rightly sweet to

241
00:18:45,997 --> 00:18:47,742
mix in with the Zap Apples.

242
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:51,957
Who'd'a thought that glass jars needed talking to?

243
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:56,528
Or that Zap Apples like pink polka dots?

244
00:18:56,529 --> 00:19:00,206
But magic is as magic does.
Just funny that way.

245
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:03,752
Then ponies started comin' to our farm from far and wide

246
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:06,432
just to get a taste of my Zap Apple Jam.

247
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:09,237
Some of them decided to stay, like Stinkin' Rich...

248
00:19:09,238 --> 00:19:11,597
...Diamond Tiara's great grandfather.

249
00:19:11,598 --> 00:19:14,200
Matter of fact, the first thing he ever sold

250
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:16,427
was my Zap Apple Jam.

251
00:19:16,928 --> 00:19:20,665
And before we knew it, we had
ourselves a nice little town.

252
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,338
Bustling with all kinds of ponies.

253
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:29,142
And that is how Ponyville was founded.

254
00:19:43,497 --> 00:19:45,788
Thank you kindly, little ponies.

255
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:48,704
Now now, let's settle down.

256
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:50,887
So if it weren't for you and the Zap Apples,

257
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:52,852
Ponyville wouldn't even exist?!

258
00:19:52,853 --> 00:19:54,634
Darn tootin', little filly!

259
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:56,766
If it weren't for my Granny Smith,

260
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:59,655
your daddy wouldn't have Barnyard Bargains.

261
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:04,574
But-

262
00:20:07,276 --> 00:20:10,531
But she's just a... kooky old lady!

263
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,833
She is not a kooky old lady!

264
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:17,220
She is the most amazing pony
in all of Ponyville!

265
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:40,209
I think this is the best Zap Apple Jam I've tasted yet!

266
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,647
Must because YOU had something
to do with it, Apple Bloom.

267
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:45,329
You betcha.

268
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,178
Apple Bloom is one humdinger of a Zap Apple Jammer!

269
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:50,482
I am?

270
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,602
So I take it Family Appreciation Day went well?

271
00:20:53,603 --> 00:20:57,898
Did it?
My Granny Smith is super special!

272
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:01,293
I just forgot that for a little while.

273
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:04,619
Aw, don't fret.
I forget things all the time.

274
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,995
Now, I'll getcha...

275
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:09,150
...somethin'.

276
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:15,472
Who wants to help Granny sing to the water?

277
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:17,362
We do!
We do!

278
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:25,259
Diamond Tiara?

279
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,631
But dad!
