1
00:00:04,159 --> 00:00:05,747
No distractions.

2
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:10,330
Today is too important.

3
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,605
Re-shelving day.

4
00:00:21,832 --> 00:00:26,065
'Understanding Mediaeval Equestria' goes in 'Pony History'.

5
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:29,223
'Modern Spellcasting', that's 'Classics'.

6
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:34,221
'The Art of the To-Do List'...
Actually, I kinda wanna read that again.

7
00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:40,017
Spike! What are you laughing at?

8
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:43,640
This little beauty is my birthday present to myself!

9
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:45,556
It's a fire ruby!

10
00:00:46,757 --> 00:00:50,039
I've been aging it for months, and it's almost ripe!

11
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:03,202
Hey, you took my advice!

12
00:01:03,203 --> 00:01:05,865
Just use the whole floor as one big shelf.

13

14
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:49,750
Hellooo? Anypony home?
Twilight?

15
00:01:51,171 --> 00:01:53,886
Is that a fire ruby?!

16
00:01:54,663 --> 00:01:57,066
That must be at least twenty carats!

17
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,530
No inclusions, pristine facets...

18
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:01,209
And totally delicious.

19
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,156
You guys don't mind?

20
00:02:04,312 --> 00:02:09,153
Of course. I just came by to see if you had any books on historical fashion.

21
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:11,581
Did you say... delicious?

22
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:13,812
Sure did! Next week's my birthday.

23
00:02:13,813 --> 00:02:16,136
And this is my birthday dinner.

24
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:18,948
Start with this one.

25
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,010
Thanks, Twilight.

26
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:27,220
I've got a feeling ruffled taffeta capes are going to make a huge comeback this season, and I want to be ahead of the game...

27
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:32,312
I hope it's as tasty as it is beautiful, Spike.

28
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:36,009
I've never seen anything quite so stunning before.

29
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:42,216
Gosh... you really like it, huh?

30
00:02:42,617 --> 00:02:47,281
Like it? It's magnificent.

31
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:54,482
Then you should have it.

32
00:02:54,683 --> 00:02:57,564
This beautiful gem was meant to be with you.

33
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,172
I don't know what to say...

34
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,580
This is so thoughtful.

35
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:07,094
Oh, my little Spikey-wikey!

36
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,591
Thank you so much!

37
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:18,410
Wow, Spike, that's one of the kindest, most generous things you've ever done.

38
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:20,939
I've never seen Rarity so happy!

39
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,137
I will never wash this cheek again.

40
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:39,688
Just about finished, Spike? Everypony will be here soon!

41
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:40,689
There. Perfect!

42
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,616
Everything looks perfect!

43
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:45,828
Not quite everything.

44
00:03:46,798 --> 00:03:49,055
A washcloth? I don't get it.

45
00:03:51,646 --> 00:03:56,940
Oh, no way, Twilight. I said I wasn't gonna wash the cheek that Rarity kissed and I meant it!

46
00:04:02,173 --> 00:04:05,084
It's over, Spike! I'm cleaning that cheek!

47
00:04:08,563 --> 00:04:09,719
It's mine!

48
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:11,392
Stop it!

49
00:04:11,393 --> 00:04:12,393
Never!

50
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,173
Happy birthday!

51
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:26,253
Party time, woohoo!

52
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,985
Are those... for me?

53
00:04:28,986 --> 00:04:31,309
You bet they are, birthday boy.

54
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,961
Happy birthday, Spike.

55
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:45,022
Don't you know you get presents on your birthday?

56
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:49,236
Well, actually, this is my first birthday in Ponyville.

57
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:54,566
I usually just get one present... from Twilight. A book.

58
00:04:58,528 --> 00:05:02,836
Speaking of presents, this is from my new line of taffeta capes.

59
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:05,197
I'm going to make one for each of you!

60
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:11,218
I've been inspired by the generosity of my little Spikey-wikey

61
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:16,509
who gave me this beautiful fire ruby, one of the kindest acts I've ever experienced.

62
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:28,285
Applejack, I can't thank you enough for this great blanket.

63
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,937
I really needed a new one.

64
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:33,322
C'mon, Spike, you already thanked me fifteen times.

65
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:35,231
I'm startin' to get a little embarassed.

66
00:05:35,232 --> 00:05:38,377
I know I keep thanking you guys, but I'm just so grateful.

67
00:05:38,378 --> 00:05:40,697
I wish this party could last forever.

68
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:45,703
The party can't last forever 'cause you have to go to Sugarcube Corner

69
00:05:45,704 --> 00:05:49,798
'cause the Cakes said they have a special surprise for you, 'cause it's your birthday!

70
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,295
No way!

71
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,319
I said the party couldn't last forever, but it doesn't need to end right now!

72
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,122
Hi, Mr and Mrs Cake!

73
00:06:01,123 --> 00:06:04,910
There's the dragon of the hour! Happy birthday, Spike!

74
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:05,811
Thanks!

75
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:12,290
When we found out it was your birthday, we couldn't resist trying out a new recipe... sapphire!

76
00:06:17,097 --> 00:06:18,844
Thank you so much!

77
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:23,213
Man, first I get a bunch of great presents from my best friends,

78
00:06:23,214 --> 00:06:25,954
and now an amazing sapphire cupcake!

79
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:27,280
What a day!

80
00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:39,441
Oh my gosh!
I'm so sorry, Cheerilee!

81
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:43,119
That's okay. What's got you so excited?

82
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:52,259
Pinkie Pie told me I should come see the Cakes, so they could give me a cake 'cause it's my birthday today.

83
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,760
Well, happy birthday, Spike!

84
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:56,050
I wish I had something to give you!

85
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,426
Here you go!

86
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:03,043
Wow, really?

87
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:06,229
Sure! Everypony should get fun gifts on their birthday.

88
00:07:08,664 --> 00:07:11,078
Have a great birthday, Spike.

89
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,706
I wish every day was my birthday...

90
00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:19,186
Pinkie Pie mentions my birthday to the Cakes, and I get a cupcake.

91
00:07:19,187 --> 00:07:22,813
I mention it to Cheerilee, and I get this great hat.

92
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:35,823
I wonder...

93
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:39,308
Hey there, Lickety Split! That's a pretty cool ball you got there!

94
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:41,684
Did you know it's my birthday?

95
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,258
This is unbelievable!

96
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:55,147
Hey Junebug!
It's my birthday!

97
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:58,738
Happy birthday, Spike.

98
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:02,880
Aren't you gonna give me something?
You know, like a birthday present?

99
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:05,876
I... I don't have anything.

100
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:09,274
- Well how about those flowers? I'll take those--
- Spike!

101
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:15,861
Sorry, Junebug, I think Spike might've gotten a little carried away.

102
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:19,609
No problem...
Happy birthday, Spike!

103
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,644
What are you doing? You're out here demanding gifts now?

104
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:29,288
You're right, Twilight. I don't know what got into me.

105
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:31,084
Thanks for snapping me out of it.

106
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:33,180
I'd better go give Cheerilee her hat back.

107
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:37,690
No problem. See you at home later?

108
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:40,020
Sounds good! Bye!

109
00:08:44,462 --> 00:08:48,535
Who else has a present for Spikey-wikey?

110
00:08:56,689 --> 00:09:02,273
Wow, what a rough night's sleep, Spike. I had the weirdest dream...

111
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:09,310
I can't believe you! Where'd you get all this--

112
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:17,279
What happened?

113
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,930
What's happening to me, Twilight?!

114
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,557
I don't know! Think back to last night.

115
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:29,093
Did something happen?

116
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,852
Spike? What did you do after I saw you?

117
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:44,185
I went to talk to...

118
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:46,767
Spike!

119
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:51,292
You went to talk to who?

120
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:53,933
I don't remember.

121
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:56,391
Hey, can I have that globe? You're not using it, right?

122
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:02,476
What about this book?

123
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:09,480
Spike, I'm worried about you. You're usually not so... grabby!

124
00:10:12,406 --> 00:10:14,884
My arms aren't usually this long either.

125
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:20,489
What's happening to me?

126
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:30,912
Well now, what seems to be the problem?

127
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:32,313
This is Spike.

128
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:35,256
And something's wrong with him.

129
00:10:35,257 --> 00:10:39,925
He used to be half this size! And he keeps trying to take things that aren't his!

130
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:44,267
All right then, let's just have a look see, shall we?

131
00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:52,616
Widdul guy not feewing too good? Who's a brave widdul boy, huh? Who's a brave one?

132
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:58,786
So? What do you think, Doctor?

133
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:02,344
Well, I think I know what the problem is.

134
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,135
He is a dragon.

135
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:08,403
That's not the problem, he's always been a dragon!

136
00:11:08,404 --> 00:11:10,629
Well, that would explain it.

137
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,660
Listen, I don't know anything about dragons, I know about baby ponies.

138
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:16,161
Maybe you should try a vet.

139
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:20,282
Okay.
Thank you, doctor.

140
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,917
Well, I'm flummoxed.

141
00:11:22,918 --> 00:11:25,429
Y'bring me a dog, I've got it diagnosed in seconds.

142
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:30,286
Snake even faster, but... to be honest, I've never seen a real live dragon before.

143
00:11:31,844 --> 00:11:36,942
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Sit.

144
00:11:42,316 --> 00:11:45,481
Thanks anyway. C'mon, Spike.

145
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,062
He is starting to mature. Of this fact I am quite sure.

146
00:12:04,063 --> 00:12:07,216
Mature? So he's just... growing up?

147
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:10,167
But that doesn't explain why he keeps grabbing things.

148
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:16,420
A dragon's heart is prone to greed, a steady diet to make growth speed.

149
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:20,793
Then, the resulting bigger size only makes their hunger rise.

150
00:12:20,794 --> 00:12:26,920
If this trait should go unchecked, if Spike continues to collect more growth will certainly occur...

151
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:29,587
He is going to turn into a monster!

152
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,118
You mean the more things a dragon collects the bigger and greedier he gets?

153
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:38,417
But how do we stop him before he's completely out of control?

154
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:44,457
If his monstrous ways you wish to impede, you must prevent him from practicing greed.

155
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:55,031
Get away from her, you brute!

156
00:12:55,132 --> 00:12:57,386
Spike want!

157
00:12:57,587 --> 00:12:59,984
You're not getting my scooter!

158
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:02,585
Spike want!

159
00:13:05,137 --> 00:13:09,207
Hey, Spike! Check out this amazing broom!

160
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:14,952
Spike want!

161
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:25,414
C'mon, big boy! Look at this incredible broom!

162
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:33,469
Spike want!

163
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:39,612
Fight all you want, I'm not letting you out!

164
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,812
Spike, I just reshelved this room!

165
00:13:57,387 --> 00:13:58,757
What now?

166
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:09,671
Now who in Ponyville would steal my apples?

167
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:12,090
For that matter, who would steal my leaves?

168
00:14:12,091 --> 00:14:16,010
Applejack, help! Spike's running wild and I need you to lasso him!

169
00:14:19,051 --> 00:14:24,173
Oh, that's a good one, Twilight. Sweet little Spike, running wild. What a laugh.

170
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,059
Twilight? Get my rope.

171
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:45,530
Help!

172
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,058
Don't tell me! You tied yourselves up?

173
00:14:56,366 --> 00:14:58,239
Get us out of here right now!

174
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:00,952
What was that?

175
00:15:00,953 --> 00:15:03,194
Sounded like Fluttershy to me!

176
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:06,185
Fluttershy? Fluttershy!

177
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:08,199
I'm up here!

178
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:10,716
What happened?

179
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:15,437
I was helping my squirrel friends with a dance step and all of a sudden,

180
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:19,809
a giant, rampaging dragon stormed through!

181
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,319
That was Spike!

182
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,669
Spike? But why would Spike steal my chicken coop?

183
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,656
He just pulled it out of the ground and filled it with a bunch of apples and stuff!

184
00:15:30,982 --> 00:15:32,838
That sounded like Pinkie Pie!

185
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,039
C'mon, girls!

186
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:36,571
Back! Get back!

187
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:45,869
Pinkie Pie! Stop giving him cake!

188
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,954
I'm not giving him cake, I'm assaulting him with cake!

189
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:55,440
How dare you take the cake!

190
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:08,892
He's completely out of control! Who knows where he'll go next!

191
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:15,651
Perhaps some more ruffle.

192
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:50,313
Put me down, you brute!

193
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:56,372
How rude.

194
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:59,072
Don't worry Rarity, we'll save you!

195
00:16:59,073 --> 00:17:01,549
Put her down, right now!

196
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,747
If you wouldn't mind, that is...

197
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:06,671
I mean it, dragon boy!

198
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:09,995
We'll be ever so grateful if you'd be so kind as to possibly consider...

199
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,423
Drop her, scaly!

200
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:18,609
Hey! I'm not some sort of common flyswatter!

201
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:28,778
Giiiiirls!
My cape!

202
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:35,655
Look! The Wonderbolts!

203
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:25,290
Oh be quiet.
You've got nothing to be proud of.

204
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:30,220
You steal everypony's things, terrorize the town, and use me as a weapon against my own friends!

205
00:18:30,221 --> 00:18:34,515
Which, as horrible as it is, I can almost understand because you're a dragon and all.

206
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:36,137
But this!

207
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:41,056
This is a crime against fashion!

208
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:52,477
Oh no, you are not getting this gemstone!

209
00:18:53,457 --> 00:19:00,877
This was given to me by my dear friend Spikey-wikey... the kindest, sweetest, most generous dragon ever.

210
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:05,090
And it is too precious to me to give to a greedy old beast like you!

211
00:19:11,677 --> 00:19:14,489
Here, Rarity, you take it.

212
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,246
It would mean even more to see you happy than to eat it myself.

213
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:24,750
I... I don't know what to say. This is just so generous.

214
00:19:33,097 --> 00:19:36,825
Oh, what now? I suppose you'll be eating me or something?

215
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:43,070
Spike?! You're the rampaging dragon?

216
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:47,511
Somepony do something!

217
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:48,978
On it!

218
00:19:56,173 --> 00:19:58,667
Rarity? I need to tell you something!

219
00:19:58,668 --> 00:20:00,418
Just in case we don't make it!

220
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:04,313
I've always sort of had a crush--

221
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:23,042
We did it! I can't believe we did it!

222
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:31,843
All in a day's work.

223
00:20:39,924 --> 00:20:43,689
Spike, I just have to tell you how absolutely proud I am of you.

224
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,018
Proud of me?

225
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:52,002
Yes. It was you who stopped... w-well you, from destroying Ponyville.

226
00:20:52,003 --> 00:20:54,986
You are my hero, Spikey-wikey!

227
00:21:01,687 --> 00:21:06,467
Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned a great lesson about friendship.

228
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:10,618
You might think that it would feel good to get lots and lots of stuff,

229
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:15,973
but it doesn't feel nearly as good as giving something special to somepony you really care about.

230
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:19,938
But I learned that it truly is better to give than to receive.

231
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:23,423
And that kindness and generosity are what lead to true friendship.

232
00:21:23,424 --> 00:21:27,637
And that's more valuable than anything in the world.

233
00:21:27,638 --> 00:21:31,113
Well... almost anything.
