1
00:00:11,088 --> 00:00:14,184
Here? I get to stay here?

2
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:17,345
Twilight Sparkle said you were coming to Canterlot for a visit

3
00:00:17,346 --> 00:00:19,360
and asked if I might accommodate you.

4
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:21,373
Thank you so much, Princess.

5
00:00:21,374 --> 00:00:22,806
You're very welcome.

6
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:25,875
No, really. This is so nice of you.

7
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,488
It's nothing, really.

8
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:29,526
But it isn't nothing, it's everything!

9
00:00:29,527 --> 00:00:32,158
I just don't know what to say but thank you, thank you!

10
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:36,791
Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,011
- You are very we-
- Thank you!

12
00:00:43,303 --> 00:00:45,161
Your luggage, mademoiselle?

13
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:48,304
I'll leave you to get settled.

14
00:00:48,505 --> 00:00:50,063
Your highness.

15
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:51,586
Enjoy your stay.

16
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:54,469
Thank you!

17
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,226
Where would you like me to put these?

18
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:02,682
That's perfect.

19

20
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:47,040
Opal, do you know what I love about Canterlot?

21
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:51,184
Everything!

22
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:55,309
I may have been born in Ponyville, but I am a Canterlot pony at heart.

23
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:58,423
Now, I know that we are here to pick up some fabrics for the shop,

24
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:04,686
but Twilight was such a dear to get me that suite at the castle I simply must make her something to express my gratitude.

25
00:02:06,857 --> 00:02:10,312
An outfit for her birthday party this weekend! Perfect!

26
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:12,962
Don't you just love it here, Opalescence?

27
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:20,796
Please excuse our interruption.

28
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:24,034
I'm Jet Set and this is my wife Upper Crust.

29
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:27,621
We saw you from across the café and just had to find out...

30
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:31,286
...where did you get that simply marvelous chapeau?

31
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:35,121
- This old thing? Oh, it's just something I-
- Rarity!

32
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:38,051
Hey Rarity!

33
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,585
It's me, Hayseed Turniptruck!

34
00:02:43,586 --> 00:02:46,234
We met at the big hoedown in Ponyville last fall?

35
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:49,727
Oh yes, of course... how are you?

36
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,477
Good! Real good!

37
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:57,471
You're from... Ponyville?

38
00:02:57,872 --> 00:03:00,714
- Well, yeah, yes, but-
- She sure is!

39
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:03,908
She's a real big-time fancy pants dressmaker there!

40
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:06,703
Probably made that real purty thing she's got on her head!

41
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:10,180
I thought it looked a little country.

42
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:13,923
I told you it wasn't something you could get here in Canterlot, dear.

43
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:19,413
They seemed real nice.

44
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,108
"Looked a little country".

45
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:31,032
"Not something you can get in Canterlot".

46
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:34,446
I'll show you something worthy of Canterlot!

47
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,641
I have to get started right away.

48
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:44,282
This new design is very ambitious,

49
00:03:44,283 --> 00:03:49,054
and I've already written to Twilight to let her know she'll have something beyond fabulous to wear to her party.

50
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,040
Fancy Pants?

51
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:01,783
I say, that's one way to make an introduction.

52
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:04,705
Oh goodness, I am so sorry.

53
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:09,844
I didn't see you there, I've just got so many bags and I was trying to get back to my suite at the castle and-

54
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:12,309
You're staying at the castle?

55
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:15,114
The Princess invited me to stay in one of the suites.

56
00:04:15,115 --> 00:04:17,149
You know the Princess?

57
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,643
Hmm, a pony with expensive tastes, I see?

58
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:23,569
It's for an ensemble I'm making for a friend.

59
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,293
Her birthday's in a few days.

60
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:29,137
Again, I am really sorry I bumped into you.

61
00:04:29,238 --> 00:04:30,649
I'm not!

62
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,597
You are obviously somepony worth bumping into!

63
00:04:35,298 --> 00:04:39,849
Listen, I have a VIP box reserved at the Wonderbolts Derby this afternoon.

64
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,532
Would you, would you be so kind as to join me and a few of my companions there?

65
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,494
- Me?
- But of course my dear.

66
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:49,989
Well, I'm, uh, ah- no- sure.

67
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,131
We'd love to see you there, uh...?

68
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:55,400
- Rarity.
- Rarity.

69
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:04,066
Pro: Seeing the Derby from a VIP box is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

70
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:08,237
Con: Going to the Derby cuts into the amount of time I have to finish Twilight's outfit.

71
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:12,151
Pro: Fancy Pants is the most important pony in Canterlot.

72
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:14,765
His stamp of approval could mean big things for me here.

73
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:18,090
Con: Twilight's party might not be as sophisticated as the Derby,

74
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:21,838
but that doesn't mean I shouldn't put all of my energy into creating her birthday ensemble.

75
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,787
My Ponyville friends will appreciate my hard work more than anypony.

76
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:27,702
I'd hate to let them down.

77
00:05:30,615 --> 00:05:31,896
And I won't.

78
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:36,295
Opal, I am going to the Wonderbolts Derby as a guest of Fancy Pants!

79
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:48,356
Pardon me. 'Scuse me, 'scuse me!

80
00:05:55,458 --> 00:06:00,175
Rarity, jolly good to see you! So glad you could make it.

81
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:11,092
Everypony, this is Rarity.

82
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:13,733
She's staying at Canterlot Castle.

83
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:21,456
Fillies and gentlecolts, welcome to the Wonderbolts Derby!

84
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:26,566
The competitors are taking their places at the starting line and the race will begin momentarily!

85
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:31,101
I'll be rooting for Rapid Fire, of course. He's sure to take home the grand prize.

86
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,516
I don't think he has a chance against Fleetfoot.

87
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:50,511
And it's Fleetfoot by a nose!

88
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,278
Bravo, Rarity. I say, how did you know Fleetfoot would be victorious?

89
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,613
My friend Rainbow Dash talks about her all the time.

90
00:06:58,614 --> 00:07:01,904
She says what Fleetfoot lacks in size, she makes up for in speed.

91
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:05,503
And who is this 'Rainbow Dash'?

92
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:15,905
Why... she's... she's the Wonderbolts' trainer, of course.

93
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:21,910
Staying at Canterlot Castle, and she knows the pegasus training the Wonderbolts.

94
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:25,139
I told you all this was an important pony.

95
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:32,913
Three cheers for Rarity, my new favorite party guest!

96
00:07:32,914 --> 00:07:38,477
Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray!

97
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:46,405
And then I said, "Puh-lease, that isn't a hat, darling, that's a natural disaster that somehow landed atop your head!"

98
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:53,892
Oh, you are a delight, Rarity, an absolute delight.

99
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:57,666
You simply must attend my art gallery opening this evening.

100
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:00,448
Oh, I'd love to, but I-

101
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:04,117
And let's not forget my charity auction tomorrow morning.

102
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:05,840
That sounds wonderful, but I-

103
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:09,870
And of course there's a seat for you at my dinner party tomorrow night.

104
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:15,761
I'm flattered, really, it's just I have a project I really need to get started on, and-

105
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:21,679
Oh, but Rarity! I may as well close down the whole gallery if you can't attend!

106
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,821
My auction is for charity dear. For charity...

107
00:08:24,822 --> 00:08:28,498
And my dinner party will be a disaster if you don't come.

108
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:32,643
Of course I'll be there.

109
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:42,604
Looks like we'll be spending a few more days here, Opalescence.

110
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:47,065
Turns out bumping into Fancy Pants like that was the best thing that's ever happened to me.

111
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:52,240
Of course, finishing Twilight's dress in time for her birthday party is still my top priority.

112
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:57,731
But I can't possibly disappoint the Canterlot elite by rejecting their invitations now, can I?

113
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:10,067
<i>I'll be the toast of the town, the girl on the go</i>

114
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:14,039
<i>And the type of pony everypony, everypony should know</i>

115
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,039
<i>I'll be the one to watch, the girl in the flow</i>

116
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,145
<i>And the type of pony everypony, everypony should know</i>

117
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:27,064
<i>Becoming as popular as popular can be</i>

118
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:31,027
<i>Making my mark, making my mark in high society</i>

119
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:35,871
<i>I'm the belle of the ball, the star of the show, yeah</i>

120
00:09:35,872 --> 00:09:40,183
<i>I'm the type of pony everypony, everypony should know</i>

121
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:44,925
<i>See how they hang on every word that I speak</i>

122
00:09:44,926 --> 00:09:48,833
<i>My approving glance is what they all seek</i>

123
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:53,969
<i>I'm the crème de la crème, not just another Jane Doe</i>

124
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:59,624
<i>I'm the type of pony everypony should know</i>

125
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:04,174
<i>At home, at the opera, on a fancy yacht</i>

126
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:08,110
<i>Becoming the talk, the talk of all of Canterlot</i>

127
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:12,976
<i>I'm the crème de la crème, not just another Jane Doe, yeah</i>

128
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:19,806
<i>I'm the type of pony everypony, everypony should know</i>

129
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:27,517
<i>Because I'm the type of pony</i>

130
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:31,138
<i>Yes, I'm the type of pony</i>

131
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:45,647
<i>Yes, I'm the type of pony everypony should know</i>

132
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,907
Oh, I hope I haven't forgotten anything.

133
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:53,762
Me... too...

134
00:10:53,763 --> 00:10:55,029
We'd better get going.

135
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,959
I must get back to Ponyville with enough time to finish Twilight's ensemble.

136
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:02,215
For me?

137
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:07,677
Dearest Rarity, your presence is requested at the Canterlot garden party tomorrow afternoon.

138
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:09,933
Yours, Jet Set and Upper Crust!

139
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,983
The Canterlot garden party!

140
00:11:12,984 --> 00:11:16,946
Right next to the Galloping Gala that is the figure event in Canterlot!

141
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:21,245
But if I go, I'll miss Twilight's birthday...

142
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:27,571
But if I don't go, my new reputation in Canterlot as a Very Important Pony might be ruined!

143
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:31,096
I might never be invited to another high society event again!

144
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:33,777
Friend's birthday... Very Important Pony.

145
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,496
It's just too important.

146
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:47,307
My dear Twilight, I am afraid I won't be able to make it to your birthday party tomorrow.

147
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:51,440
Because... because poor Opal is quite ill!

148
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:56,088
And she is in no condition to make the long journey back to Ponyville.

149
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:01,351
I do hope you understand. Your friend, Rarity.

150
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:04,852
I suppose this means you don't need me to bring down your bags?

151
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:08,498
No.
But, I will need some help unpacking them.

152
00:12:12,004 --> 00:12:13,889
What do you think? Too much?

153
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:17,195
You're right. Too little.

154
00:12:18,177 --> 00:12:20,392
Garden party, here I come!

155
00:12:21,162 --> 00:12:22,956
Surprise!

156
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:29,736
Swoosh! And right before she hit the ground, shoom, she-

157
00:12:29,737 --> 00:12:31,037
Hi again!

158
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:33,756
What are you- how did you- Why are you-

159
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:37,584
Listen to her, she's so excited to see us she can hardly talk.

160
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:40,628
What I mean to say is, what are you all doing here?

161
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:43,441
When I got your letter saying you were stuck in Canterlot,

162
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:47,154
I asked Pinkie Pie if it wouldn't be too much trouble to move my birthday party here,

163
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:48,655
so you wouldn't have to miss it!

164
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:50,640
Balloons are super easy to pack.

165
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,080
First you get me a suite at Canterlot castle and now this...

166
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:01,515
I don't know what to say, Twilight.

167
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:05,620
How about you start by saying what you're doing in that fancy getup?

168
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:13,365
This? Well I always put on something a little fancy when Opal's feeling under the weather...

169
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:14,366
Cheers her right up.

170
00:13:16,103 --> 00:13:19,512
Oh, poor Opal, where is the sick darling?

171
00:13:19,513 --> 00:13:22,474
Uh, she's... hold on a minute.

172
00:13:26,732 --> 00:13:28,711
I am so sorry about this.

173
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:37,878
She's resting on the bed.

174
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,967
Poor baby. She looks awful.

175
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:46,140
Is... that my dress?

176
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:47,241
Yes.

177
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:50,274
It's so... simple.

178
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:51,575
So practical...

179
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:56,329
So me! It's the perfect dress for my birthday party!

180
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,530
I love it!

181
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:02,097
You don't know how glad I am to hear you say that.

182
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,861
When I told the Princess that I was moving the party to Canterlot,

183
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:12,453
she was kind enough to offer us the Canterlot castle ballroom!

184
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,794
Isn't it fancy pants?

185
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:18,106
Fancy Pants?! Where?!

186
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:25,117
I mean, where did you find the time to put up all these decorations?

187
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:30,410
I never leave home without my party cannon.

188
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:40,346
I thought about having my birthday outside, but they're having another party on the castle grounds today.

189
00:14:48,374 --> 00:14:50,502
Let's party!

190
00:15:16,938 --> 00:15:19,635
No reason I can't at least make an appearance...

191
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:32,195
I'm here!

192
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:35,115
Darling, I'm so glad you made it.

193
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:38,527
Rarity! So happy to see you here.

194
00:15:38,528 --> 00:15:41,053
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.

195
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:46,283
I say, what is that scent you're wearing? It smells like...

196
00:15:46,284 --> 00:15:48,500
...is that cake frosting?

197
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:53,514
Yes, I always dab a little frosting behind my ears before I go out.

198
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:57,957
After all, who doesn't like the smell of cake frosting?

199
00:15:58,772 --> 00:16:00,265
I know I do.

200
00:16:02,348 --> 00:16:05,546
Well, all this talk about cake has made me hungry.

201
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:09,608
Think I'll go and see what's on the hors d'oeuvres table. If you'll excuse me.

202
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:52,162
I think I left the bathwater running in my suite.

203
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:55,206
I really should go check on Opal...

204
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:57,524
Is that Princess Celestia?

205
00:16:57,525 --> 00:16:59,467
I need to use the little fillies room!

206
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:01,271
Can I get anypony more punch?

207
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:06,432
I... have to go to do the... thing with the... stuff in uh...

208
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,537
What's with the croquet mallet?

209
00:17:08,538 --> 00:17:09,538
What croquet mallet?

210
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,705
Duh, the one in your mouth!

211
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:19,883
Oh, that croquet mallet.
I- well I, you know, the truth is... the truth is...

212
00:17:19,884 --> 00:17:22,625
Were you at that other party in the garden?

213
00:17:23,238 --> 00:17:25,652
I, I...

214
00:17:25,953 --> 00:17:28,750
Rarity, I'm surprised at you.

215
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:30,477
Twilight let me explain! I-

216
00:17:30,478 --> 00:17:33,503
I hadn't realized you were such a savvy businesspony!

217
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:35,289
You must understand! I-

218
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,119
All of those ponies look so posh.

219
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,188
And with the Grand Galloping Gala coming up, I bet you could totally get some of them to buy your dresses.

220
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:44,289
Very smart!

221
00:17:45,994 --> 00:17:53,702
Why yes, I didn't want you to think I was being rude, so that's exactly the reason I didn't tell you.

222
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:55,688
One and only reason.

223
00:17:57,459 --> 00:18:01,226
Well you didn't have to do that. You should totally go over there and mingle!

224
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:06,739
Twilight, you really are the best friend a pony could ever ask for.

225
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,842
I don't know why I ever thought you wouldn't understand.

226
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:11,191
Understand what?

227
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:13,599
Nothing. See you girls later!

228
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,991
Hey, wait up!

229
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:17,240
We're your friends!

230
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:19,703
I'm sure they won't mind if we check out the party too!

231
00:18:19,704 --> 00:18:23,861
C'mon you guys! Let's show them how to party Ponyville style!

232
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:28,845
Oh no!

233
00:18:54,078 --> 00:18:56,317
How come y'all aren't doing any gardening?

234
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:58,590
This is a garden party, isn't it?

235
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:07,513
Can you believe what that pony is wearing?

236
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,405
It's just so plain.

237
00:19:09,906 --> 00:19:10,906
Yeah.

238
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:16,783
Excuse me, might I ask where you got your ensemble?

239
00:19:16,784 --> 00:19:18,891
Why yes, yes you may.

240
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:23,082
A very, very close friend of mine from Ponyville made it for me.

241
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,505
Ponyville? You don't say?

242
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:30,547
I do say. Her name is-

243
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:31,991
Fancy Pants! Come with me!

244
00:19:31,992 --> 00:19:35,175
I'd like to show you this... thing... that's over there.

245
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:36,276
On the other side of the room.

246
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:37,824
In a moment, my dear.

247
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:43,510
This lovely filly from Ponyville was just about to tell me who made her charming dress.

248
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:46,834
That dress? Oh come now, who cares, it's just a plain old-

249
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:50,244
Oh don't be so modest, this dress you made is beautiful!

250
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:56,912
We all think so!

251
00:19:57,713 --> 00:19:59,874
You know these ponies?

252
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:15,204
Yes. Yes, I do know them.

253
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:18,496
They may not be as sophisticated as some of you Canterlot ponies,

254
00:20:18,497 --> 00:20:20,308
but they are my best friends.

255
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:24,380
And they are without a doubt the most important ponies I know.

256
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:28,996
Important ponies? These ruffians?

257
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:31,124
Don't make me laugh!

258
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:36,356
I, for one, find them charmingly rustic.

259
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:40,934
And I think the dress you made for your friend is lovely.

260
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:45,211
I dare say every mare in Canterlot will be wanting one.

261
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:48,114
I'd like to place my order right now.

262
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:49,819
I think you should get two.

263
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:56,277
Yes, now then, how about you introduce me to your friends?

264
00:20:56,278 --> 00:20:57,478
With pleasure!

265
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,672
Dear Princess Celestia,

266
00:21:01,673 --> 00:21:05,797
I wanted to tell you about the important lesson I learned during my visit.

267
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,312
Now that I would like to hear.

268
00:21:08,313 --> 00:21:11,209
I learned that no matter where you go in life,

269
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,946
you should never forget that you are the product of your home and your friends.

270
00:21:14,947 --> 00:21:19,329
And that is something always to be proud of, no matter what.

271
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,949
A very valuable lesson to have learned.

272
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,150
It certainly is!

273
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:28,067
But... might I ask that we hurry things up a bit?!
