1
00:00:02,783 --> 00:00:07,281
I want to start our field trip here,
in the world famous Canterlot Sculpture Garden.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,267
That one over there
represents friendship.

3
00:00:13,683 --> 00:00:15,321
All right, my little ponies!

4
00:00:15,322 --> 00:00:17,446
This one represents victory.

5
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:20,114
How cool would it be to have
*that* for a cutie mark!

6
00:00:20,114 --> 00:00:21,662
Cool!

7
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:25,123
If you were actually
victoryful at somethin'.

8
00:00:25,363 --> 00:00:26,854
That's not a word!

9
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,903
What are you? A dictionary?

10
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:29,983
Girls!

11
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:33,624
Now this is a really interesting statue.

12
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,946
What do you notice about it?

13
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:37,726
It's got an eagle claw!

14
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:40,412
-And a lion paw!
-And a snake tail!

15
00:00:40,644 --> 00:00:43,198
This creature is called a draconequus.

16
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:46,936
He is the head of a pony and a body
made up of all sorts of things.

17
00:00:46,937 --> 00:00:49,039
What do you suppose that represents?

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,203
-Confusion!
-Evil!
-Chaos!

19
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:54,386
It's not chaos, you dodo!

20
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,893
Don't call me things
I don't know the meaning of!

21
00:00:56,894 --> 00:00:58,784
And it is too chaos!

22
00:00:58,785 --> 00:00:59,642
Is not!

23
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:01,234
You're both wrong!

24
00:01:10,063 --> 00:01:12,448
Actually, in a way you're all right.

25
00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:15,498
This statue represents discord...

26
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:18,416
...which means a lack of
harmony between ponies.

27
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:21,899
In fact, you three have
demonstrated discord so well...

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,356
...that you're each going to
write me an essay explaining it.

29
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:30,139
Now let's go. And I don't
want any more fighting.

30
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:33,496
-It's confusion!
-Evil!
-Chaos!

31
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:24,194
Come back here, you!

32
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,448
Gotcha!

33
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,918
Eeew! What is this?

34
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:34,631
Cotton candy?

35
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,246
Wait a second! It's not supposed
to rain until tomorrow!

36
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,776
You can't just...!

37
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,395
You did.

38
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:54,154
Hey! I didn't tell you to go anywhere!

39
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:57,294
Rainbow Dash! What's
going on with that rain?

40
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:58,534
I mean... chocolate milk?

41
00:02:58,535 --> 00:03:00,497
I mean... chocolate milk rain?!

42
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:03,100
There's crazy weather
all over Equestria!

43
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:05,890
Cloudsdale's getting soaked
by a major cola storm right now.

44
00:03:06,138 --> 00:03:09,625
But don't worry. I'm not leaving you,
till I get control of Ponyville.

45
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,799
Why would you wanna stop *this*?

46
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:21,507
I heard about your troubles, Applejack,
and I came to see if there's anything I could do.

47
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:23,538
Without getting wet. Or dirty.

48
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:25,410
Or out from under my umbrella.

49
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:35,389
Fluttershy! Do somethin'!

50
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,740
Now Angel, you really shouldn't...

51
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:40,100
No! It's not possible!

52
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:42,335
I must be seeing things!

53
00:03:44,046 --> 00:03:48,172
Don't worry, everyone! I've learned
a new spell that'll fix everything.

54
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,640
My fail-safe spell...

55
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:05,154
...failed! What do we do?

56
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:06,368
Uh... Give up?

57
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:09,527
Spike. Twilight will come up with something.

58
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:12,627
Time for Plan B.

59
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:16,118
Rainbow! Can you corral all those
clouds in one corner of the sky?

60
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,951
Applejack! I need you to bring those
high strong storm clouds down to earth.

61
00:04:35,282 --> 00:04:37,042
Hey! What happened?

62
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:44,306
Oh dear! I hope that none
of the animals see these...

63
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:47,220
...delicious chocolate-filled
cotton candy clouds.

64
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,489
I'd hate to have to share them.

65
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:52,566
You and me both, sister!

66
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:54,772
Hey!

67
00:04:56,388 --> 00:05:00,321
And when y'all are done that, feel free
to have some popcorn for dessert.

68
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:03,019
You see, Spike? You
should never give up.

69
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,564
There's nothing we can't
overcome if we all work together.

70
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,199
Come on, girls! Princess Celestia wants
to see us all in Canterlot immediately!

71
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:27,895
Princess Celestia! We came
as fast as we could.

72
00:05:28,682 --> 00:05:31,331
Thank you, Twilight. Thank you all.

73
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,574
Is this about the weather?
And the animals' weird behavior?

74
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:36,719
What's happening out there? Why
isn't my magic working? Is there...?

75
00:05:37,318 --> 00:05:38,525
Follow me.

76
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:41,579
I've called you here
for a matter of great importance.

77
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:43,835
It seems an old foe of mine...

78
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:47,111
...someone I thought I had
defeated long ago, has returned.

79
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:50,309
His name is Discord.

80
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:54,516
Discord is the mischievous
spirit of disharmony.

81
00:05:54,517 --> 00:05:56,690
Before my sister and I
stood up to him...

82
00:05:56,691 --> 00:06:00,851
...he ruled Equestria in an eternal state
of unrest and unhappiness.

83
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:04,161
Luna and I saw how miserable
life was for earth ponies...

84
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:06,227
...pegasi and unicorns alike.

85
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:08,699
So after discovering
the Elements of Harmony...

86
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,982
...we combined our powers
and rose up against him...

87
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:13,675
...turning him to stone.

88
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:15,507
Alright, Princess!

89
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:18,343
I thought the spell we cast would
keep him contained forever...

90
00:06:18,343 --> 00:06:21,228
...but since Luna and I are
no longer connected to the Elements...

91
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,280
...the spell has been broken.

92
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:24,974
No longer connected?

93
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:28,957
This is Canterlot tower, where
the Elements are kept inside...

94
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,322
...since all of you recovered them.

95
00:06:31,323 --> 00:06:35,862
I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony
once again and stop Discord...

96
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:39,427
...before he thrusts
all of Equestria into eternal chaos.

97
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:41,379
But why us? Why don't you...?

98
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,330
Hey, look! We're famous!

99
00:06:43,331 --> 00:06:46,026
You six showed the full
potential of the Elements...

100
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:49,946
...by harnessing the magic of your
friendship to beat a mighty foe.

101
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:52,583
Although Luna and I
once wielded the Elements...

102
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:54,980
...it is you, who now control their power.

103
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,768
And it is you, who must defeat Discord!

104
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,794
Princess Celestia, you can count on...

105
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:05,012
Hold on a second!

106
00:07:05,013 --> 00:07:08,660
Eternal chaos comes with
chocolate rain, you guys!

107
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,515
CHOCOLATE RAIN!

108
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,531
Don't listen to her, Princess.

109
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,296
We'd be honored to use
the Elements of Harmony again.

110
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:33,866
You can keep the Elements.
I'll take that case.

111
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:35,635
Have no fear, ponies.

112
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:39,165
I have total confidence that you
will be able to defeat Discord...

113
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:40,494
...with these.

114
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,939
Oh well. If anyone needs me...

115
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,121
...I'll be outside in the chocolate
puddles with a giant swizzle straw.

116
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,297
The Elements! They're gone!

117
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:03,551
That chamber is protected by
a powerful spell that only I can break.

118
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:05,567
This doesn't make sense...

119
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:12,014
"Make sense"? Oh, what fun
is there in making sense?

120
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:14,315
Discord! Show yourself!

121
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:20,332
Did you miss me, Celestia?

122
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:23,219
I've missed you.

123
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:27,771
It's quite lonely being encased in stone.
But you wouldn't know that, would you?

124
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:31,513
Because I don't turn ponies into stone!

125
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:36,126
Enough! What have you done
with the Elements of Harmony?

126
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:39,474
Well, I just borrowed them
for a teensy little while.

127
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,363
You'll never get away
with this, Discord!

128
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,444
Oh, I'd forgotten how grim
you can be, Celestia.

129
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:49,937
It's really quite boring.

130
00:08:49,937 --> 00:08:52,301
Hey! Nopony insults the Princess!

131
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:58,063
Oh! You must be Rainbow Dash...

132
00:08:58,064 --> 00:09:01,556
...famed for her loyalty ‒ the Element
of Harmony you represent.

133
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:04,672
That's right! I'll always
be loyal to the Princess!

134
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:06,620
We'll see about that.

135
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,047
I can't believe we're wasting our time
talking to a tacky window.

136
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:13,873
The beautiful Rarity, representing
the Element of Generosity...

137
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:15,724
...if I'm not mistaken.

138
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:18,183
So you know who we are. Big deal.

139
00:09:18,185 --> 00:09:21,213
Oh, I know much more than
that, honest Applejack.

140
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:23,443
You seem to know our strengths too.

141
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:25,514
Yes, Twilight Sparkle.

142
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:29,540
And yours is the most powerful
and elusive element ‒ magic.

143
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:33,940
Fluttershy's is kindness and Pinkie Pie's
is the personal favorite of mine...

144
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,431
...laughter!

145
00:09:35,882 --> 00:09:36,928
Pinkie!

146
00:09:37,723 --> 00:09:40,070
He's standing on your head!

147
00:09:41,026 --> 00:09:42,790
Stop stalling, Discord!

148
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,076
What have you done with
the Elements of Harmony?

149
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:48,413
Oh! So boring, Celestia. Really.

150
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:52,225
Fine. I'll tell you, but
I'll only tell you my way.

151
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:57,573
To retrieve your missing elements,
just make sense of this change of events.

152
00:09:57,574 --> 00:10:00,623
Twists and turns are my master plan...

153
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:04,189
...then find the Elements
back where you began.

154
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,714
Can we go home now?

155
00:10:07,714 --> 00:10:09,381
What do you reckon he meant?

156
00:10:09,382 --> 00:10:11,856
"Twists and turns" and then
the "back where we started".

157
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:13,287
Twists and turns...

158
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:15,247
Twists and turns...

159
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,153
Twists and turns! That's it!

160
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:21,229
I bet Discord hid the Elements
in the palace labyrinth!

161
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:23,411
Good luck, my little ponies.

162
00:10:23,562 --> 00:10:27,226
The fate of Equestria is in your hooves.

163
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,562
Thanks, Princess. We won't let you down.

164
00:10:36,696 --> 00:10:39,338
We... We have to go in there?

165
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:43,171
Nope! Dopey Discord
forgot about these babies!

166
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:46,591
I'll just do a quick flyover and
we'll have the Elements in no time.

167
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,016
My wings!

168
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:55,536
Your horn!

169
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:56,685
My horn!

170
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:11,494
You... You should see the looks
on your faces. Priceless!

171
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:14,373
Give us our wings and horns back!

172
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,073
You'll get them back in good time.

173
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:18,501
I simply took them to ensure
there's no cheating.

174
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:21,197
You see, this is the first
rule of our game:

175
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:24,685
No flying and no magic.

176
00:11:25,445 --> 00:11:27,289
The first rule?

177
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,228
The second rule is: everypony has to play
or the game is over.

178
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:33,383
And I win.

179
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:36,319
Good luck, everypony!

180
00:11:40,103 --> 00:11:42,594
Never fear, girls. We have each other.

181
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:44,908
Yeah! Like Twilight said.

182
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:48,541
There's nothing we can't overcome
if we all stick together.

183
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,390
All right, girls! Let's do this.

184
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,662
Together!

185
00:11:58,014 --> 00:11:59,324
Stay calm, girls!

186
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:02,731
Everypony head to the middle as fast as
you can and we'll regroup there.

187
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:05,162
-Moving out!
-See you in the center.

188
00:12:05,163 --> 00:12:07,419
-Yeehaw!
-See you guys there!

189
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:12,496
What's that?! Who's there?! GIIIRLS!

190
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:28,386
What in tarnation?

191
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:35,270
Where am I?

192
00:12:45,202 --> 00:12:46,455
Who are y'all?

193
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:49,440
The keepers of the grove of truth.

194
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:51,069
You may ask us...

195
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:53,297
...a one question:

196
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:55,725
Past, future or present.

197
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:57,266
But be warned...

198
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:58,829
...that the truth...

199
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,202
...may not always be pleasant.

200
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:04,705
Alright then. I don't trust
this place for the hill a' beans...

201
00:13:04,706 --> 00:13:07,776
...but I got a real bad feelin'
about this feller Discord.

202
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:10,096
What's gonna come of this
here mission we're on?

203
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,865
For the answer you seek...

204
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:19,036
...go ahead! Take a peek.

205
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:23,845
I hope I'll never see you again!

206
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:24,965
Me too!

207
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:26,830
-Fine!
-Fine!

208
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:28,523
It's settled then.

209
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,287
No!

210
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:36,529
Our friendship... over?

211
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:45,595
It can't be true. It just can't!

212
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:56,977
That just can't be the truth.

213
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:59,169
When all the truth does...

214
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,441
...is make your heart ache...

215
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:05,637
...sometimes a lie is easier to take.

216
00:14:11,962 --> 00:14:15,602
Applejack! Thank goodness.
I thought I heard voices over here.

217
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:17,269
Who were you talking to?

218
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,578
I was talkin' to, uh...

219
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:22,308
Nopony! Nopony whatsoever.

220
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:25,082
What?

221
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:26,229
Nothin'.

222
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:28,597
Come on. Uh, we best be goin'.

223
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:31,231
Did Applejack just...

224
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:34,892
Come on, Twilight.
Applejack wouldn't lie.

225
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:50,884
This is the greatest
balloon garden I've ever seen!

226
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:53,945
It's the first balloon garden
I've ever seen, but still...

227
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:02,496
Hey! What gives?

228
00:15:02,497 --> 00:15:06,579
What's the matter, Pinkie Pie?
I thought you appreciated a good laugh.

229
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,520
It's different. They're
laughing *at* me.

230
00:15:09,521 --> 00:15:11,718
It's hardly different.

231
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,271
Your friends laugh at you all the time.

232
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:16,865
My friends laugh *with* me, not at me.

233
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:18,636
Oh, really?

234
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:26,701
No! Stop it!

235
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:36,610
Stop laughing at me!

236
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:40,145
Oh, poor Pinkie Pie.

237
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:43,658
And here I thought
laughter made you happy.

238
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:46,842
Happy?

239
00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:49,773
I don't think so.

240
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:55,888
Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you.

241
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:59,483
You are, huh? WHY? Need a good laugh?

242
00:15:59,484 --> 00:16:00,580
Pinkie?

243
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:05,186
What do you suppose has her
so upset? It's not like her.

244
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:07,686
I didn't notice anythin'
strange about Pinkie.

245
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:13,910
Weird. Better pick up the pace before
the stress of this gets the better of all of us.

246
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:22,721
I was expecting an audience with
the Princess, not outdoor sports.

247
00:16:24,222 --> 00:16:25,088
Oh my.

248
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:33,556
Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity.

249
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:38,730
You've found the one thing in Equestria
that could rival my face for sheer beauty.

250
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:44,064
What do you think? You like?

251
00:16:44,244 --> 00:16:47,727
Yes... I like very much.

252
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:54,279
NO! No. I shan't succumb
to such fabulousness.

253
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:59,228
Must... get to the center...
to meet... the others...

254
00:17:01,573 --> 00:17:02,692
MINE!!!

255
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:07,265
Well, Rarity...

256
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:09,651
It took forever, but it was worth it.

257
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:17,022
Who knew three little gemstones would turn out
to be this handsome HUNK of a diamond?

258
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:20,187
Now to get you home.

259
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:30,414
Rarity! Are we glad to see...

260
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:32,954
Why are you carrying
a humongous boulder?

261
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:35,531
What do you mean "boulder"?

262
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:39,781
This big, beautiful, bedazzling
rock is a DIAMOND!

263
00:17:39,782 --> 00:17:41,918
And it's all mine.

264
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:43,982
Keep your envious little eyes off it!

265
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:46,822
I found it and it's mine,
fair and square!

266
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,172
Okay, I can do this. I can...

267
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:04,521
Oh! Wait a minute!

268
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:07,738
Butterflies? Wait! Don't leave me here!

269
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,856
Fluttershy.

270
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:19,352
Looks like you've been left behind
by your so-called friends, huh?

271
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:24,148
Oh, no. I'm certain they're
doing their best to find me.

272
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:28,897
Well, it must be so upsetting to know how
weak and helpless they think you are.

273
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:30,281
Not at all!

274
00:18:30,282 --> 00:18:33,770
I *am* weak and helpless and
I appreciate their understanding.

275
00:18:33,771 --> 00:18:36,905
Yes, well... surely it burns you up, I mean...

276
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:40,290
...that they're always
pointing out your flaws, right?

277
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,764
Not really. In fact...

278
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:46,715
I think I'm awfully lucky to have friends
who want me to be the best I can be.

279
00:18:48,187 --> 00:18:49,724
Oh, for goodness's sake!

280
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:52,442
You've been kind for
far too long, my dear.

281
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:54,443
Time to be cruel!

282
00:18:54,444 --> 00:18:56,200
Arrivederci!

283
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,391
Fluttershy! I'm so glad
to see your friendly face.

284
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,902
This awful labyrinth is
getting to everypony.

285
00:19:06,997 --> 00:19:09,026
Oh, boo hoo hoo!

286
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:13,664
Why don't you wave your magic little horn
and make everything all right?

287
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:18,214
Oh, that's right. You can't.
You don't have one.

288
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:22,881
What is happening to my friends?

289
00:19:23,044 --> 00:19:25,252
And what are YOU laughing at?!

290
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,505
Chocolate milk!

291
00:19:27,139 --> 00:19:28,767
Little help here?

292
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,634
Thanks, Twilight.

293
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:34,333
-You're welcome...
-But don't get any ideas about my gem!

294
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,542
I know where you live.

295
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:49,090
I've got you now, Element.

296
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:58,030
I can see why you like these
clouds so much. Very plush.

297
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:01,437
Get off there and put 'em up!
C'mon, let's go!

298
00:20:01,438 --> 00:20:04,362
Hey, I'm here to deliver a message.

299
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:06,286
I've got a message for you too!

300
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:08,957
Listen closely. This is important.

301
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:13,058
A weighty choice is yours to make ‒
The right selection or a big mistake.

302
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:18,942
If the wrong choice you choose to pursue,
The foundations of home will crumble without you.

303
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:26,879
Cloudsdale? Crumble... without me...

304
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:29,496
NO!!!

305
00:20:30,972 --> 00:20:34,194
That box contains your wings.
You can take them and leave the game...

306
00:20:34,195 --> 00:20:39,293
...or you can carry on aimlessly
wandering this maze. Your choice.

307
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:49,149
Must... find... Rainbow Dash...

308
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:53,325
As a team... we're unstoppable.

309
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:56,619
Rainbow Dash won't let us down.

310
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,240
Well, lookie there.

311
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:01,615
Rainbow Dash is flyin' away.
She's abandonin' us.

312
00:21:01,616 --> 00:21:03,426
Now I know that's a lie.

313
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,675
How can it be?!

314
00:21:16,437 --> 00:21:21,973
Well, well, well. Somepony broke
the "no wings, no magic" rule.

315
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:27,606
Game's over, my little ponies.

316
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:30,778
You didn't find your precious elements.

317
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:36,784
Looks like we might be due
