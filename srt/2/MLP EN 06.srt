1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,113
Today's the day, Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can just feel it!

2
00:00:05,114 --> 00:00:11,133
Today's the day we are all gonna get our cutie marks in... bowling!

3
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:18,161
I mean, yay!

4
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:22,518
Why, after today, we won't even be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore!

5
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,381
We'll be the... the Three Strikes!

6
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:27,559
That makes us sound like we've struck out.

7
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:32,054
Mmm. How about the Pin Twins?

8
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:34,696
But there are three of us!

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,621
Okay then... Um... the Bowling Dolls!

10
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,616
The Bowling Dolls! That's it!

11
00:00:44,617 --> 00:00:45,817
Perfect!

12
00:00:45,818 --> 00:00:49,221
All righty then! Let's bowl 'em over!

13
00:01:31,914 --> 00:01:34,386
Cool! A bowling cutie mark!

14
00:01:34,987 --> 00:01:37,270
I did it! I did it!

15
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:39,894
Blank?

16
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:47,904
But... but... what about my ball?

18
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:37,798
That bowling sure was fun,

19
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:39,626
even if all I got was gutter balls.

20
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:43,260
Yeah, at least you were able to keep your ball in your lane.

21
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:46,597
I don't think Mr. Kingpin is ever gonna let me play again!

22
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:52,342
Hey, maybe I could get my cutie mark in demolition!

23
00:02:58,324 --> 00:02:59,900
Aw, come on, Apple Bloom.

24
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:03,585
I know just what you need to put the bloom back on your apple.

25
00:03:05,554 --> 00:03:08,427
A treat from Sugarcube Corner will cheer you up.

26
00:03:10,177 --> 00:03:11,489
No it won't.

27
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,657
A party will cheer you up.

28
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:18,546
No it won't.

29
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,944
A lovely new chapeau will cheer you up.

30
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:26,429
No it won't!

31
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:30,468
Come on, Apple Bloom, it's just a cutie mark!

32
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,718
Or lack of a cutie mark!

33
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,430
Shh! That's not helping!

34
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:37,493
Apple Bloom! Where are you going?!

35
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:40,619
Apple Bloom, come back!

36
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:57,370
Well, who is it that we have here?

37
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,843
Why, it's Apple Bloom, my dear!

38
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:05,707
What has happened to you, youth?

39
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:10,091
Ah, you've gone and chipped your tooth.

40
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:13,045
Come with me, I have just the trick,

41
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:15,241
that will fix you up quite quick.

42
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:21,334
I've tried everything, Zecora, and still no cutie mark!

43
00:04:21,335 --> 00:04:25,713
Well, I'm gonna be as old as Granny Smith and still have a blank flank!

44
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:28,745
Your frustration is well understood,

45
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:31,660
but one must be patient for all things good.

46
00:04:32,827 --> 00:04:35,485
I've heard that from every pony I know!

47
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:38,582
And now from every zebra I know!

48
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:41,566
I'm just too impatient to be patient.

49
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:45,359
I just want my cutie mark and I want it now!

50
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:53,974
For your cutie mark, you will have to wait.

51
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:56,437
We must fix that tooth before it's too late.

52
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:02,835
Now drink down every little drop,

53
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,530
and this mixture will mend that chip on top!

54
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:21,285
Oh my star apples, you did it, Zecora!

55
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,441
Golly...

56
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:26,839
you have tonics that heal all sorts of ailments.

57
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,901
Bad bones, bad back, bad breath...

58
00:05:29,902 --> 00:05:32,136
Yes little one, it is true,

59
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:33,698
I have many a healing brew.

60
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:38,541
And not only stuff that fixes the bad, but stuff that brings the good!

61
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:41,588
Good health, good hair... good heavens!

62
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:49,117
I bet you can mix up a brew to fix... anything.

63
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:53,964
There are many mixtures in this room,

64
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:56,667
but none for what you want, dear Apple Bloom.

65
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:59,790
A magic potion does not hold the key,

66
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:04,194
for a cutie mark, time is the only remedy.

67
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:05,295
Fine...

68
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,192
Whatcha got going on there?

69
00:06:14,193 --> 00:06:17,646
I am brewing up another mix for a rooster and his chicks.

70
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:20,574
It seems the rooster has lost its crow,

71
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:22,736
making mornings very slow.

72
00:06:23,037 --> 00:06:25,880
Hey, I've seen that flower blooming in Ponyville!

73
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:26,881
What is it?

74
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:29,709
It is one we call 'Heart's Desire'.

75
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,487
A dash will ignite the rooster's fire.

76
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:38,068
With Heart's Desire, his talent comes into view,

77
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:41,081
and he'll give a mighty cock-a-doodle-doo!

78
00:06:42,895 --> 00:06:44,780
Zowie!

79
00:06:45,574 --> 00:06:47,643
Heart's Desire, huh?

80
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:52,114
Ay me, but what is this? I have run out of amethyst.

81
00:06:52,115 --> 00:06:56,080
I must go get this purple flower, for my brew to have full power!

82
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,444
Yeah, you go, you go.

83
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,536
- I'm so hungry.
- Yeah, I can't wai--

84
00:07:13,981 --> 00:07:17,202
Apple Bloom! You got your cutie mark!

85
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,940
Apple Bloom... what is it?

86
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:32,438
Yeah! Is it an 'o'? Is your talent spelling?

87
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:35,410
Or is it a ring? Are you a jewelery maker?

88
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:39,330
Or is it a powdered donut? 'Cause that sounds delicious.

89
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:41,966
Nope, it's a loop-de-hoop!

90
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:46,887
A what now?

91
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:50,363
A loop-de-hoop! 'Least, that's what I always called it.

92
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:53,976
Applejack made it for me from an old rain barrel when I was littler!

93
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:57,808
Who knew that loop-de-hoop would end up bein' my special talent!

94
00:07:58,122 --> 00:08:00,823
Wow, Apple Bloom, that's amazing!

95
00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:03,377
That's it? That's your talent?

96
00:08:03,378 --> 00:08:07,159
Spinning a hoop around your waist? Puh-lease.

97
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,221
Oh, you ain't seen nothin' yet.

98
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:31,511
Apple Bloom, you're super-duper-loop-de-hooper!

99
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,000
Thanks, everypony!

100
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:38,404
All right, my little ponies, time for class!

101
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:43,910
Apple Bloom?

102
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:45,965
Yes, Miss Cheerilee?

103
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:49,751
I want you to take your loop-de-hoop into the yard,

104
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,699
and give us all a lesson on your amazing loop-de-hooping!

105
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:17,949
Don't worry, gals. Keep at it and you might get to be half as good as me!

106
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:23,967
Great job, girls!

107
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:25,874
You're too kind, Apple Bloom.

108
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,548
Yeah, we stink.

109
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:30,538
Nah, you just need a little practice.

110
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:33,679
Soon you'll be able to... hoop and bump!

111
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:37,659
Hoop and hop!

112
00:09:39,482 --> 00:09:40,917
Hoop and skip!

113
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,901
And hoop and flip!

114
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,281
Show us some more, Apple Bloom.

115
00:09:54,282 --> 00:09:57,498
Well, all right, just a few more tricks.

116
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:58,499
But be warned!

117
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,226
These are advanced moves, not for beginners.

118
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:04,891
Got that, Diamond Tiara?

119
00:10:06,894 --> 00:10:10,327
I call this one the hoop-la!

120
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:31,495
Huh? Oof!

121
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:35,350
Another cutie mark? Hah! I guess that last trick was a lot of hoop-la.

122
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:37,348
Those cutie marks are fake!

123
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:40,911
What? No they're not!

124
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:45,939
Miss Cheerilee, have you ever heard of a pony with two cutie marks?

125
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:52,327
I must say that I never have, but maybe Apple Bloom has two special talents!

126
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:56,313
Oh yeah? Then let's see you do that!

127
00:10:56,902 --> 00:10:59,058
- Spin plates!
- Yeah!

128
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:06,162
Two cutie marks?

129
00:11:06,163 --> 00:11:07,949
Two talents?

130
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:11,925
Aw yeah!

131
00:11:12,426 --> 00:11:16,152
Our friend... is the most special pony ever!

132
00:11:16,874 --> 00:11:20,815
Alright, everypony, You ready for a real show?

133
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:32,376
Yee haw, little sis! Congratulations on gettin' not just one, but two cutie marks!

134
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:35,127
We're mighty proud of you, right Big Macintosh?

135
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:36,128
Eeyup.

136
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:40,051
I've never seen anythin' like it, have you Big Mac?

137
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,052
Nope.

138
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:46,088
Why, the way you were a-hoopin' and a-hoppin' and kickin' and spinnin'

139
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:49,309
reminded me of when I was a spry young filly.

140
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:52,182
Guh, charlie horse, charlie horse!

141
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,932
That's better.

142
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:01,043
Why Apple Bloom, I think you're ready to hit the rodeo circuit right now!

143
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:05,980
Actually, I'm ready to hit the hay right now. I'm plum tuckered.

144
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:09,258
I'll see y'all in the mornin'. Night!

145
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:10,259
Night!

146
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,933
Oh my, little Apple Bloom has finally blossomed, hasn't she, Big Mac?

147
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,171
What in tarnation is that?

148
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:34,535
Apple Bloom, what is all that awful...

149
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:37,295
tapping?

150
00:13:38,396 --> 00:13:40,508
Three cutie marks?!

151
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:42,430
Help me!

152
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:47,476
Help me!

153
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,441
C'mere, you!

154
00:13:57,681 --> 00:14:01,420
I'm sorry, Applejack! I dunno how to make it stop!

155
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:03,952
Well I know somepony who might!

156
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,645
Three cutie marks. Three talents.

157
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:12,675
I've never seen anything like it!

158
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:16,301
I was just reading something about unusual equine illnesses.

159
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:17,502
What was it?

160
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:21,208
'Perplexing Pony Plagues', perhaps?

161
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,477
Yes, Spike, you're amazing!

162
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:28,537
Yes, well, I do have some talents.

163
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:36,063
Hay fever... the trots...

164
00:14:36,764 --> 00:14:38,803
Cutie pox!

165
00:14:38,804 --> 00:14:40,604
- Cutie Pox?!
- Cutie Pox?!
- Cutie Pox?!

166
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:47,156
Cutie Pox. This puzzling pony plague afflicted a population of ponies back in the paleopony period!

167
00:14:47,157 --> 00:14:49,250
Say that ten times fast!

168
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:54,499
Random cutie marks appeared all over the ponies' bodies,

169
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,378
causing them to perform all the talents that came with them!

170
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,232
Just like me!

171
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,183
Yes, but what's the cure? What's the cure?!

172
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:06,677
It says here there's no known cure!

173
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:08,478
No known cure?!

174
00:15:09,437 --> 00:15:11,966
The cause of the breakout was never discovered,

175
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:15,232
and the cutie pox disappears as mysteriously as they arrived!

176
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:16,433
Oh no...

177
00:15:18,935 --> 00:15:21,965
Sacrebleu! Plus de marque de cutie!

178
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:25,693
Qu'est-ce que c'est?! Je parle français?!

179
00:15:26,494 --> 00:15:28,956
My sister's speakin' in fancy!

180
00:15:28,957 --> 00:15:29,957
She needs help!

181
00:15:30,358 --> 00:15:32,168
I know she needs help!

182
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:34,244
We can't just wait for this to go away!

183
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:37,528
We gotta find somepony to mix up a cure! And fast!

184
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:38,915
Tout de suite!

185
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:42,207
Not some pony... some zebra!

186
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:44,582
Zecora!

187
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:51,695
Hurry, hurry!

188
00:15:51,696 --> 00:15:53,296
Dépêchez-vous!

189
00:16:24,814 --> 00:16:25,898
She's cursed!

190
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:27,875
Hexed!

191
00:16:29,234 --> 00:16:30,736
Enchanted!

192
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:32,237
No, she's not.

193
00:16:33,896 --> 00:16:38,188
She just has some weird mysterious disease with no known cure called cutie pox.

194
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:40,510
Cutie pox?!

195
00:16:52,164 --> 00:16:56,061
I thought I had removed their fear the last time that I visited here.

196
00:16:56,062 --> 00:17:01,990
But, doors are barred and shutters shut, guess I should've stayed inside my hut.

197
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:05,033
Zecora! Apple Bloom has cutie pox!

198
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:09,785
We were just on our way to see if you had a cure!

199
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:13,285
But magically you're here! Was your zebra sense a-tinglin'?

200
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:15,874
My 'zebra sense' did not bring me round,

201
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,709
it was a special flower that I needed found.

202
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,568
I thought I picked enough to mix the potions I had to mix,

203
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:28,414
but after my visit from Apple Bloom, some had mysteriously left my room.

204
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:32,850
Apple Bloom! What do you say? Did this flower just walk away?

205
00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:37,809
I, um...

206
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:46,312
A cutie pox cure I have forsooth,

207
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:50,868
for healing power is in the seeds of truth.

208
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,334
Well, well then give 'em to her! Quick!

209
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:55,994
These seeds must be planted in the ground.

210
00:17:55,995 --> 00:17:59,722
With the truth, they'll grow, and the cure is found.

211
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:01,255
Come again?

212
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:08,347
The seeds of truth do hold the cure, but one must speak words, true and pure.

213
00:18:10,863 --> 00:18:12,346
Well then let's get to it!

214
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,707
Alright, they're planted,

215
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,486
now somepony tell the truth!

216
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,573
Somepony! Anypony!

217
00:18:38,469 --> 00:18:42,095
Yesterday I told Mrs Cake that I ate two corn cakes, but I really ate three!

218
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,666
Okay six! I ate six corn cakes!

219
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:58,603
Make it stop! Oh, make it stop!

220
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:06,554
Wah, I can't stand it any more! It's me! I admit it! I didn't earn my cutie mark!

221
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:07,755
They're all fake!

222
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:17,726
I figured the Heart's Desire would help me get what I wanted most!

223
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,972
So when Zecora left her hut,

224
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:24,010
I mixed up a special potion and put the rest of the Heart's Desire in it!

225
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:44,478
Apple Bloom!

226
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:45,479
Are you okay?

227
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,692
I'm great, and I've never been happier to be a blank flank.

228
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:54,210
But I'm awful sorry I lied, 'specially to you gals.

229
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:58,340
I was so desperate for my cutie mark, I just got carried away.

230
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:02,322
And I'm really sorry I snuck those flowers from you, Zecora.

231
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:05,905
I- I wouldn't blame you if you never wanted me to come by again.

232
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:11,152
Now, Apple Bloom, do not be silly. You are always welcome, my little filly.

233
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:16,973
With each mistake you learn something new, growing up into a better you.

234
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:24,863
Apple Bloom, would you mind writing to Princess Celestia and telling her what you've learned?

235
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:26,369
I'd be happy to, Twilight!

236
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,745
- Spike?
- Ready!

237
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,508
Dear Princess Celestia,

238
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:34,685
waiting for what your heart desires can be really hard.

239
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:36,901
So, you may try to take a shortcut.

240
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,897
But this dishonesty never works,

241
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:41,393
because you didn't earn what your heart desired.

242
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:44,663
The only cure is being honest with yourself, and others.

243
00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:47,492
And that's something every heart desires.

244
00:20:50,838 --> 00:20:52,561
I sure am proud of you, sis.

245
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:56,210
Seems like you finally learned the importance of patience.

246
00:20:56,211 --> 00:20:59,648
Yup! All good things come to those who wait.

247
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,296
Well! I've waited long enough.

248
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,904
Actually, that was way too long.

249
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:08,505
What?!

250
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:11,648
So what are we gonna do today to earn our cutie marks?

251
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:15,643
Well, I was thinking, for a pony who's never mixed up a potion before,

252
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:17,633
you sure stirred up something fierce.

253
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:20,560
Yeah! So what if your talent is potion making?

254
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:24,864
Oh my gosh, totally! Let's go talk to Zecora, now!
