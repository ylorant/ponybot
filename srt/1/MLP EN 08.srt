1
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,540
Perfect.

2
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,730
Just take the broken limbs down, Rarity.

3
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,140
Don'tcha all care about nothing other than prettifyin'?

4
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,550
Somepony has to. You were making an absolute mess of the town square, Applejack.

5
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,420
Yeah, well, the storm's gonna make an even bigger mess

6
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,080
if we don't prune all these loose branches so they don't tumble down on anypony.

7
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:04,090
I simply cannot imagine why the pegasus ponies would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening

8
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,200
and ruin what could have been a glorious sunny day.

9
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,990
Think more practical-like, will ya?

10
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,590
They accidentally skipped a scheduled sprinkle last week,

11
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,090
so we need a doozy of a downpour to make up for it, is all.

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,340
Oh no! My wonderfully styled mane shall be ruined!

13
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,030
Ya shoulda hurried up and finished the job already.

14
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,560
It's coming down too fast!

15
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,880
Help me!

16
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,050
There. Hunker down to your heart's content whilst I finish this.

17
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,750
Oh, no, no, no!

18
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,310
What now?

19
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,680
I prefer not to get my hooves muddy.

20
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,670
There is just no pleasin' ya, is there?

21
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,770
Everything's got to be just so.

22
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,580
Well, and how does muddying my hooves serve any useful purpose?

23
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,970
Y'all wouldn't know useful if it came up and bit cha.

24
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,240
That doesn't even make any sense.

25
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,520
- Does so.
- Does not.

26
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,200
- Does so.
- Does not.

27
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,750
- Does so.
- Does not.

28
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,750
- Does so infinity.

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,750
- Does not infinity plus one.

30
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,580
What say we go our separate ways before one of us says something she will regret.

31
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,130
I reckon y'all're gonna say something you'll regret first.

32
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,260
On the contrary. I belive it shall most certainly be you who says something you will regret first.

33
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,910
- I'm not sayin' anythin'.
- Nor am I.

34
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,980
- Y'all just be on yer way, then.
- After you!

35
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,150
Perhaps we should stick together for now and find some shelter.

36
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,780
Perhaps we should.

37
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,980
Sounds fair.

38
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,170
Nice and dry under here, sort'a.

39
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,470
Unacceptable.

40
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,380
Applejack! Rarity!

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,810
Applejack! Rarity!

42
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,830
Twilight?

43
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,040
Come inside, girls, quick.

44
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,050
Whoa, Nelly. Is inside a tree really the best place to be in a lightning storm?

45
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,290
It is if you have a magical lightning rod protecting your home like I do.

46
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,920
Come on in!

47
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,840
We are most grateful for your invitation.

48
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,710
Thank ya kindly for your hospitality.

49
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,680
Do be a polite houseguest and go wash up please, won't you?

50
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,370
If I gotta stand one more second with that fussbudget Rarity today,

51
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,870
I can't be held responsible for what I'm gonna do.

52
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,370
Some storm, huh? The pegasus ponies sure have outdone themselves this time.

53
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,310
I hope you and Applejack don't have any trouble getting home.

54
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,290
It may indeed be a problem.

55
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,200
Well, you're welcome to stay if need be.

56
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,300
Spike is away in Canterlot on royal business. I'm all alone tonight.

57
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,830
You and Applejack should totally sleep over! We'll have a slumber party!

58
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,720
I've always wanted one of those.

59
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:59,790
Goodness. Uh, I do believe I have another engagement scheduled for this evening that completely slipped my mind until just now.

60
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,820
Silly me, I can't possibly stay here all night... with Applejack.

61
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,330
Slumber 101: All You've Ever Wanted to Know About Slumber Parties But Were Afraid to Ask.

62
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,550
My own personal copy. It's a fantastic reference guide. You should see the table of contents.

63
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:30,580
I've been waiting for a chance to use it, and today is the day! This is gonna be so great!

64
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,030
Yes, uh, great.

65
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,520
What in tarnation...

66
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:04,930
Now wait just a goll-darn minute. Ya make me wash the mud off my hooves, but it's okay for y'all ta have mud all over your faces?

67
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,850
Silly! This is called a mud mask. It's to refresh and rejuvinate your complexion.

68
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,330
We're giving each other makeovers!

69
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,590
We have to do it, it says so in the book.

70
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,770
Slumber 101: Everything You...

71
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:28,410
Oh hey, heh, would ya look at the time. I gotta skidaddle on home quick. I'm powerful late for, uh, fer somethin'.

72
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,260
Good night.

73
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,280
Or maybe I'll stay here for a spell.

74
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,130
Hurray slumber party!

75
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,140
What in the world is this for?

76
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,420
To reduce the puffiness around one's eyes, of course.

77
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,570
Puffiness-schmuffiness!

78
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,780
That's good eatin'!

79
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,860
Isn't this exciting? We'll do everything by the book

80
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,230
and that will make my slumber party officially fun.

81
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:15,290
Did you hear that, Applejack? You certainly would not want to do anything that would ruin Twilight's very first slumber party, would you?

82
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,940
Of course not, 'n you wouldn't either, I reckon.

83
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,000
So do we have an agreement?

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,820
You betcha.

85
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,140
Gross!

86
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,990
You know, there's messy and there's just plain rude.

87
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,560
You know, there's fussy 'n there's just plain gettin' on my nerves.

88
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,690
Fortunately, I can get along with anypony, no matter how difficult she may be.

89
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,050
Oh yeah? Well, I'm the get-alongin'ist pony your ever gonna meet.

90
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,960
That's not even a word.

91
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,100
This is going to be the bestest slumber party ever! Yay!

92
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,100
Yay.

93
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,020
So, how are you getting along over there, Applejack?

94
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,580
Just fine, Rarity.

95
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,150
This is so awesome! Makeovers, check.

96
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,260
It says here we have to tell ghost stories. Who wants to go first?

97
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,830
Me!

98
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,800
I'd like to tell y'all the terrifying tale of the prissy ghost who drove everypony crazy

99
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,540
with her unnecessary neatness.

100
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,210
I'm sure y'all are familiar with that one.

101
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,560
Never heard of it. I have a much better one.

102
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:46,530
It's the horrifying story of the messy, inconsiderate ghost who irritated every pony within a hundred miles!

103
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,340
That's not a real story. You made it up.

104
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,150
It is a ghost story, they're all made up.

105
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:03,460
I got one! This story is called The Legend of the Headless Horse.

106
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,520
It was a dark and stormy night, just like this one.

107
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,710
And three ponies were having a sumber party, just like this one.

108
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:26,240
...and just when the last pony thought she was safe, there, standing right behind her,

109
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,800
just inches away was...

110
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,050
the Headless Horse!

111
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,390
Ghost story, check.

112
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,400
Now, who wants s'mores?

113
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,460
Then you place one marshmallow on the top of the chocolate and be sure it's centered, that's critical,

114
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,820
and then carefully put another perfectly square graham cracker on the top.

115
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,700
And done. Ta-da!

116
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,290
Nah, ya just eat 'em.

117
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,580
You could at least say excuse me.

118
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,750
Aw, I was just about to, but you interrupted me.

119
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,160
Pardon.

120
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,220
S'mores, check.

121
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,010
Now the next item of fun we have to do is Truth or Dare.

122
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,940
I dare Applejack to do something carefully and neatly for a change.

123
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:37,700
Oh yeah? Well I dare Rarity to lighten up and stop obsessin' over every last little detail, for a change.

124
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,620
I think the truth of the matter is that some pony could stand to pay a little more attention to details.

125
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,910
And I think the truth is some pony oughta quit with her fussin' 

126
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,010
so the rest of us can get things done.

127
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,880
I don't think this is how the game's supposed to work. 

128
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,220
You have to give an honest answer to any question or do whatever any pony dares you to do.

129
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:04,090
I dare you to step outside and let your precious, tidy mane get ruined again.

130
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,670
You have to. It's the rule.

131
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,510
Fine!

132
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,210
Okay. I dare Applejack to play dress-up in a fru-fru, glittery, lacey outfit.

133
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,920
Happy?

134
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,270
Very.

135
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,590
Do I ever get a turn?

136
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,690
I dare ya to enter the next rodeo when it comes to town.

137
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,840
I dare you not to enter the next rodeo that comes to town.

138
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,690
I dare ya to not comb your mane a hundred times before bed.

139
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,880
And I dare you to comb yours just once.

140
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,520
I, uh, I think we should check off Truth or Dare and move on. 

141
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,390
Let's see what our next fun-fun-fun thing is, shall we? 

142
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,030
Hm, what does this mean? Pillow fight?

143
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:05,640
Oh, please. I am not at all interested in participating in something so crude. 

144
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,840
Oh! It! Is! On!

145
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,450
Oh, I get it! Pillow, fight! Fun! 

146
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,900
Girls, maybe we should take it down a notch?

147
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,460
I will if she will.

148
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,010
She started it.

149
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,960
Maybe we should just call it a night and get some sleep? 

150
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,630
Keep your muddy hooves on your side of the bed.

151
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,330
My hooves ain't muddy.

152
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,100
They were. There might still be a little on them.

153
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,740
There ain't. See?

154
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,800
Now who's bein' inconsiderate?

155
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,250
I have to make the bed again so the blanket will be right. Get up.

156
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,140
You'll ruin it. You have to do it like this. 

157
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,870
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

158
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,600
Geronimo!

159
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,950
You did that on purpose.

160
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,720
Um... yeah.

161
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,610
Get up so I can fix it again.

162
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,280
Can't hear ya, I'm asleep.

163
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,880
I ain't budgin'.

164
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,760
You will if you want any blanket.

165
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,570
- Give it back!
- I will not!

166
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,870
- Yes, you will!
- Won't!

167
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,480
- Will!
- Won't!

168
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,470
- Will!
- Won't!

169
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,970
Enough! 

170
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,780
It says right here that the number one thing you're supposed to do at a slumber party is have fun, 

171
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,750
and thanks to you two I can't check that off!

172
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,700
I've been tryin' my darndest to get along.

173
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,730
No, it is I who've been trying my best.

174
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,640
- No, it was me.
- No, it was I.

175
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,970
- Me!
- I!

176
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,620
I hope you're happy, both of you. You've ruined my very first slumber party. 

177
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,220
The makeovers, the s'mores, Truth or Dare, the pillow fight...

178
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,330
 I mean, is there anything else that could possibly go wrong? 

179
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
 Sorry I asked. 

180
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:18,310
Ya see? That's why we needed to take down all those little branches in town, not spiffy 'em up.

181
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,150
- But I...
- Outta my way, missy! Time's a-wastin'.

182
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,600
Wait! Stop! Don't!

183
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,130
No watin'! No stopin'! Doin'! 

184
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,520
And that, my friend, is what we call gettin' 'er done.

185
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,420
I tried to tell you it would come crashing down in here.

186
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,400
Well, ya shoulda tried harder. 

187
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,130
I'm mighty sorry, Twilight.

188
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:08,490
It's... Well, it's not okay. There's a giant tree branch in the middle of my bedroom. 

189
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,300
And the book doesn't say anything about having a giant tree branch at your slumber party. 

190
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,930
Or at least I haven't found that entry yet. Ur... ah!

191
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,110
What in tarnation are y'all doin' over there?

192
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:25,690
Cleaning up this mess some pony made. Who was that again? Oh, right, that's you.

193
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,960
We gotta do somethin'.

194
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,410
Baking... BFFs... Brothers... There's nothing in here about branches.

195
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,990
Rarity, for pony's sake, stop sweatin' the small stuff and help me get rid of this thing! 

196
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,780
I said hussle over here and help me! 

197
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,310
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

198
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,520
What was that?

199
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,820
I said I'm sorry! 

200
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:07,390
I shoulda listened to you when you noticed where this here branch would end up. Your annoyin' attention to detail 

201
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:13,110
woulda saved us from this whole mess. But right now, ya need to stop bein' so dang fussy pickin' up 

202
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:17,990
all those little things and help me move the one big thing in here that actually matters! 

203
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,640
Please!

204
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,440
But I'll get all icky.

205
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:32,870
Consarnit! What the... eh... you... I mean, yes, ickiness is often a side effect of hard work. 

206
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,650
But y'all need to get over it, on account I just can't fix this mess I made myself.

207
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,480
 I need your help.

208
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,730
Let's do this.

209
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,970
Well, they do have a section about backyard slumber parties. Is that what we're doing right now? Does this count as camping?

210
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,810
Oh, I look awful.

211
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,640
Better?

212
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,980
Thanks.

213
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,190
Oh, pretty! Where did these come from? 

214
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,160
They're not in the book either. 

215
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,900
Is it bigger than a barn?

216
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,750
Nope.

217
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,740
Is it smaller than a saddle?

218
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,150
No! Only three of your twenty questions left!

219
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,830
We're never gonna guess what y'er thinkin' of, it could be anythin'.

220
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,870
Are we getting warmer?

221
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,200
Why? Is it too cold in here for you? I can turn up the heat.

222
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,690
She means are we gettin' any closer with our guesses?

223
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,720
No. 

224
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,150
And that technically counts in as a question, so only two more left!

225
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:35,190
Is it... a six-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted mane and shootin' stars comin' out of his eyes?

226
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,780
Who flies through the air all over the world to hide magic, sparkly eggs?

227
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,610
That's it!

228
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,150
It is?

229
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,610
No. 
It's that. 

230
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:54,090
But it was just so nice to see you two finally getting along, I wanted you to be able to win together.

231
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,850
See? We could have been having fun like this all along.

232
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,690
If only some pony hadn't been so persnickety.

233
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,820
Well, maybe she wouldn't have been if some pony else hadn't been so sloppy.

234
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,610
Sorry for being such a pain in the patootie.

235
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,950
Oh, no, I'm sure I was much worse.

236
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,780
That's kind a ya ta say, but I'm the one who's sorry.

237
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,780
Oh, I'm much more sorry than you are.

238
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,240
- Are not.
- Are too.

239
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,880
- Are not!
- Are too.

240
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,490
- Are not!
- Are too.

241
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,970
I declare my first slumber party a success!

242
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,870
Have fun, check.

243
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,920
Now take two steps to your left. Uh, no, my left.

244
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,240
Which is it? 

245
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,360
That mess is your fault, not mine.

246
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,440
Sorry.

247
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,980
Dear Princess Celestia,  it's hard to believe that two ponies who seem to have so little in common could 

248
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,850
ever get along. But I found out that if you embrace each other's differences, you might just be surprised to discover 

249
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,350
a way to be friends after all.

250
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:13,980
So, who's up for another slumber party tomorrow night? 

251
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,490
How about a week from Thursday? 

252
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,580
Oh, how about two weeks from Saturday? 

253
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,640
A month from now?
