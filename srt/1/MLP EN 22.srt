1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,150
There you go, Mr. Mousey.

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,330
Now you stay off that leg and do everything I told you. And it will be just like new in no time at all.

3
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,880
Oh, you're welcome. Happy to be able to help.

4
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,720
You... found a watch?

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,960
You... wanna be a watch?

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,370
You're running!

7
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,590
Running out of time? No. You're... late?

8
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:57,570
I'm late for a very important date! The big brunch for Princess Celestia at Sugarcube Corner.

9
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:06,150
The Princess is here in Ponyville for a party and we all promised we'd be there. But I'm not there!

10
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,320
Do I look all right? Do I need to bring anything? Maybe I shouldn't go?

11
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,780
It's starting! I'm missing it!

12
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,020
Thanks, Angel.

13
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,020
I mean, if if you hadn't reminded me, I might have not remembered and then...

14
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,910
then I wouldn't be there and everypony would be wondering where I was and...

15
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,980
Oh, right. I'm late.

16
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,070
Oh, okay then. See you later.

17
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,410
So... what do I have to do to get to be one of the Princess's royal guards, anyway?

18
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,500
Is the pay good?

19
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,160
Hellooo! Anybody home?

20
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,380
Ooh, you're good.

21
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,430
Too good. I'm bored.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,630
Made it.

23
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,720
- Halt!
- Who goes there?

24
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,790
No one. Nevermind. I'll go home.

25
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,310
It's all right, sirs. She's on the list.

26
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,720
Thanks, Twilight.

27
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,260
I'm so glad you could make it, Fluttershy. It wouldn't be the same without you.

28
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,110
How's everypony doing? Good? Good.

29
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,690
Anything else we can get for you, dearies...? Ooh, I-I mean, esteemed guests.

30
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,160
Everything is fine, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

31
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,080
Sorry I'm late. I had to finish taking care of a patient first.

32
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:44,060
Oh, you and your Tender Loving Care of little animals. I just know Princess Celestia is gonna love that about you.

33
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,240
I mean, I hope she will... I mean, of course she will!

34
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,500
Wow, Twilight. I thought I was the only one who got nervous at social gatherings.

35
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,430
Oh, it's not that. I just want the Princess to approve of my friends.

36
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,100
But she's met us all before.

37
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,930
And read about you in my letters.

38
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,240
But this is the first time she spent any real time with you. I want everypony to make a good impression.

39
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,830
Well, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. Besides, it's just a casual get-together, right?

40
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,360
Don't touch me! Watch the dress!

41
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,850
Careful, you're gonna spill that on me!

42
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,660
Oh, oh, that looks delicious. What is it? 

43
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,400
Oh, does it stain?! Keep it away from me!

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,230
Or... perhaps not that casual.

45
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,080
Which is the salad and which is the appetizer again? And which am I supposed to eat first?

46
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,200
Oh, nevermind. I'm not hungry.

47
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:46,440
It's okay, Twilight. So our friends' manners aren't perfect. I doubt the Princess will even notice.

48
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,200
Cookies, candies and pies! Oh my!

49
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,180
Chocolate Fountainy goodness!

50
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,830
You gonna eat that?!

51
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,650
A thousand pardons, your Majesty.

52
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,980
That's quite all right, thank you.

53
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,280
- Empty teacup at 4 o'clock!
- I see it, honey bun!

54
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,170
- Thank you.
- Not at all, your Highness.

55
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,070
- Thank you again.
- But of course, your Majesty.

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,780
Gotcha!

57
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,940
And what about you, dear? Fluttershy, is it?

58
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,570
Me? Oh yes, your Highness.

59
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,510
I understand from Twilight Sparkle's letters that you enjoy tending to the needs of woodland creatures.

60
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,570
Yes, I love to take care of animals.

61
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:59,670
As do I. As Princess, I care deeply about all creatures, great and small.

62
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,570
Nothing means more to me than the well-being of all my subjects.

63
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,830
Philomena, my pet. You're awake. Do say hello to our gracious hosts.

64
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,800
Oh, my.

65
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,190
She is quite a sight, isn't she?

66
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:28,410
I... I... I've never seen anything like it.

67
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,560
Really? Well, if I must...

68
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,760
I'm sorry, everypony. I'm afraid I have to cut the party short.

69
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,280
The mayor has requested an audience with me. Royal duty calls.

70
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,860
Thank you for a wonderful time. It's been a joy getting to know you all better.

71
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,860
Now I can eat someth'n! I'm starved!

72
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,140
Stay right where you are. All I want is a clear path to the exit.

73
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,070
NOBODY MOVE and my dress won't get hurt! Stay back! Back, I say!

74
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:33,400
Well, Spike, I don't know for sure how things went with the Princess, but at least no big disasters happened.

75
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,400
Oh, you poor little thing. How did you ever get in such bad condition? 

76
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,280
Don't you worry, Philomena. I'll nurse you back to health. 

77
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,340
As a favor to the Princess, who's obviously just far too busy to care for you properly. 

78
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,850
I'm sure the Princess will appreciate the help. 

79
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,120
Oh my. We'd better get you to bed right away.

80
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,680
There.

81
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,680
This is far worse than I thought. What you need is some medicine. Stat!

82
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,630
Here you go, Philomena. This will fix you right up.

83
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,430
Doctor Fluttershy expected that.

84
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,450
Always works.

85
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,690
Almost always.

86
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,950
There's nothing like home-made soup to cure what ails you.

87
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,690
Come on now. You'd not gonna get better if you don't cooperate.

88
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,530
See? It's delicious. Good and good for you. 

89
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,200
Here come the choo-choo train. Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo!

90
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,650
Oh dear. Don't worry, Philomena. I know what'll make you feel better. 

91
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,290
Wait right here. I have just the thing.

92
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,580
Look, Philomena. I brought a fellow feathered friend by to cheer you up. 

93
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:09,000
Hummingway here was sick once too, but he let me help him and got better in no time. Didn't you, boy? 

94
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,560
Say hello to your new friend Philomena.

95
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,450
Aw, look. I think he likes you.

96
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,540
Your turn now, Philomena. 

97
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,450
Go ahead. You can do it.

98
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,830
Good try?

99
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,170
I know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat. A humidifier. 

100
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:54,110
Refreshing. How's that feeling now for you, Philomena? Better?

101
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,690
That's okay. I know lots of other ways to take care of you. 

102
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,270
Don't worry. You're gonna get better. How about...

103
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,040
Aromatherapy?

104
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,410
Warm bath?

105
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,500
Ointment?

106
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,430
Scalpel. 

107
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,060
Surgical tape.

108
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,310
 Feathers.

109
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,640
Oh, Philomena. I thought it would be easy to nurse you back to health. 

110
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:05,320
I've tried everything I know. And look at you. You're worse than ever. 

111
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:15,710
Hi, Fluttershy! I just wanted to drop by and say thank you so very much for making such a good impression on the Princess today...

112
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,870
What is Celestia's pet doing here?!

113
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,220
I couldn't leave the poor thing there. She needed my help.

114
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,450
Oh no. NonononononoNO! This is bad.

115
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,300
How could I just walk away and not do anything?

116
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,401
But... but... she doesn't belong to you!

117
00:12:31,441 --> 00:12:33,282
I had to do something.

118
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:36,350
Without telling anypony?! Without asking permission?!

119
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,660
But...

120
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,000
I know you had good intentions, but you have got to return Princess's pet!

121
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,740
But...

122
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,080
You're right. Okay, let's...

123
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,670
...go.

124
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,440
If we hurry, we can put her back before anypony even realizes she's missing.

125
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,240
We were told we could find Twilight Sparkle here.

126
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,640
We regret to inform you, miss, that the royal pet has gone missing.

127
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,130
Really? You don't say!

128
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,560
- It's that dry night air.
- But it's daytime.

129
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,950
Well... day air's even drier. 

130
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:48,710
You guards better be on your way if you're gonna find the Princess's missing pet. 

131
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:53,110
Philomena, was it? Thank you ever so much for keeping me in the loop. BYE! 

132
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,340
What are you doing?!

133
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,370
Going to return Philomena, remember?

134
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,720
- We can't now! 
- Why not?

135
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,040
You have no idea what the Princess is gonna do if she finds you're the one who took her pet, do you?!

136
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,250
Do you?

137
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,790
Well... no. But it can't be anything good. 

138
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,830
She might banish you from Equestria. Or throw you in a dungeon. 

139
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,390
Or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon in the place that she banishes you to.

140
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:29,740
You really think the Princess would do that?

141
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,700
Okay. Granted that probably won't happen, but do you wanna take any chances?

142
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,080
All that really matters to me is that poor little Philomena here gets well.

143
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,340
That's very noble of you. I'll write to you when you're banished. 

144
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,350
Unless I'm banished too somewhere there's no post office. Then you'll have to write to me. Deal?

145
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,540
Please, Twilight. You just have to help me get Philomena healthy 

146
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,960
and then we can return her to the Princess. And everything will be fine.

147
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,750
Did you give her any kind of medicine?

148
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,960
I tried to, but she wouldn't take it.

149
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,920
Then you have to MAKE her take it. You can't be such a pushover, Fluttershy! 

150
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,720
You need to show this patient who's the boss. Make her straighten up and fly right!

151
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,650
She can't fly.

152
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,490
No excuses!

153
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,330
Done. Okay, what else?

154
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:26,460
Well, she keeps pulling her feathers off. The ones that haven't fallen out yet from all her coughing, I mean.

155
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,390
There you go.

156
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,850
I don't think she likes it.

157
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,100
Tough love, baby. You want her to get well, don't you?

158
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,010
- Of course, but...
- NEXT!

159
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:43,830
Well, she desperately needs some bed rest, but I can't get her to stay put.

160
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,270
One step ahead of you.

161
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,780
It's for your own good, Philomena, I promise. Please, just relax and try to get some sleep.

162
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,990
What's this soup over here? Smells delicious.

163
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,310
I made it for Philomena. But she wouldn't eat it.

164
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,680
Oh, she'll eat it, all right.

165
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,140
Hey! Where are you going?

166
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,680
No! Philomena! Come back! 

167
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,660
What are you two doing? Are you having a race? 

168
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,170
Oh, can I play? 123GO! 

169
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,390
- Excuse me!
- Hi!

170
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,080
- Beg your pardon!
- Put me down!

171
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,870
What in tarnation?!

172
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,840
- Sorry, but we've gotta find...
- The Princess's pet bird!

173
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,030
Philomena! Come down from there! You'll hurt yourself!

174
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,540
I'll catch you!

175
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,800
What is going on here? 

176
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,070
Twilight?

177
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:18,110
Yes, Your Majesty? There's been a terrible accident.

178
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,420
It's all my fault.

179
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,540
No, Princess. Fluttershy didn't know any better. It was my fault.

180
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,550
- I'm the one who did it.
- But you were only trying to help.

181
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:32,090
- Some help I was.
- Will ya let me do this? She'll go easier on me.

182
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,160
- But it's my fault!
- No, it's my fault!

183
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,800
No! It's my fault! Wait. What are we talking about?

184
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,800
Thanks for trying to protect me, Twilight, but... Princess Celestia, I'm the one who took your pet bird. 

185
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:50,260
I really was only trying to help the poor little thing. Then I was gonna bring it back to you, honest.

186
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:59,100
 So, if you wanna banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to, then that's what I deserve.

187
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,320
Oh, stop fooling around, Philomena. You're scaring everypony. 

188
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,580
I don't understand! 

189
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,800
What is that thing? What happened to Philomena?

190
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,410
This is Philomena. She's quite a sight, as I said. 

191
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,190
But nothing unusual for a phoenix. Isn't that right, Philomena?

192
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,340
A... A phoenix?

193
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:44,430
A phoenix is a majestic and magical bird. While it appears healthy and happy most of the time, 

194
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:49,830
every so often it must renew itself by shedding all of its feathers and bursting into flame. 

195
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,290
Rather melodramatic, if you ask me. 

196
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:59,550
It then rises from the ashes, fresh as a daisy. All just a normal part of the life cycle of a phoenix. 

197
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:04,810
I'm afraid, mischievous little Philomena here took the occasion to have a little fun with you, Fluttershy. 

198
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,980
Say you're sorry, young lady.

199
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,000
So... aren't you gonna banish me? Or throw me in a dungeon? 

200
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,150
Or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to?

201
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:19,520
Of course not, my little pony. Where on Earth would you get such an idea?

202
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,070
I guess I have some imagination.

203
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,200
Fluttershy really did do everything she could to try to take care of Philomena for you.

204
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,380
And I do appreciate that your heart was in the right place, child. 

205
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,500
But all you had to do was ask me and I could have told you Philomena was a phoenix and saved you all this trouble.

206
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:41,230
I know. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. Next time I'll ask before taking matters into my own hooves.

207
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,320
Should I write you a letter about that lesson, Princess?

208
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,600
No, that's quite all right. I think I can remember.

209
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:01,510
It's beautiful. Thank you, Philomena. No hard feelings.

210
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:20,958
Yes!
