1
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:13,265
Spike, wake up. Wake up, wake up, it's Winter Wrap Up day!

2
00:00:13,873 --> 00:00:16,985
- Huh? Mommy?
- Winter Wrap Up!

3
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:18,913
You're not mommy.

4
00:00:18,914 --> 00:00:26,369
Spike, the first day of spring is tomorrow, so every pony in Ponyville needs to clean up winter. Now help me get ready.

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:34,132
Clean up winter? Who cleans up winter? Don't they just use magic to change the seasons like they do in Canterlot?

6
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:41,034
No Spike, Ponyville was started by earth ponies, so for hundreds of years they've never used magic to clean up winter. 

7
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,985
It's traditional.

8
00:00:44,634 --> 00:00:48,764
It's ridiculous. No magic... Fuh.

9
00:00:51,700 --> 00:01:03,453
Okay, let's see: scarf, check; saddle, check; boots, check; Spike refusing to get up and going back to sleep, check. It's a good thing I'm so organized, I'm ready. Bright and early.

10
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,105
Oh... maybe a little too early. 

11
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,335
Those must be the team vests Rarity designed. 

12
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:57,478
Blue for the weather team, green for the plant team, and tan for the animal team. I wonder which team vest I'll be wearing.

13
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,332
I'll take a blue vest, same color as my blanket, which I think I hear calling my name.

14
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:07,133
 "Spike! Spike! Come to bed!" 

15
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:10,274
Ugh, it's too early.

16
00:02:11,187 --> 00:02:18,522
Thank you everypony, for being here bright and early. We need every single pony's help to wrap up winter, and bring in spring.

17
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:30,191
Now, all of you have your vests, and have been assigned to your teams, so let's do even better than last year, and have the quickest Winter Wrap Up ever!

18
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,160
Oh, this is so exciting.

19
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:41,166
Alright everypony, find your team leader... and let's get galloping!

20
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:46,726
Oh gosh, where should I go? I'm not sure where I fit in. 

21
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:51,475
What exactly does everypony do?

22
00:02:51,476 --> 00:02:54,327
Three months of winter coolness 

23
00:02:54,328 --> 00:02:56,654
And awesome holidays 

24
00:02:56,655 --> 00:02:59,488
We've kept our hoofsies warm at home 

25
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:01,541
Time off from work to play 

26
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:04,209
But the food we've stored is runnin' out 

27
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,690
And we can't grow in this cold 

28
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:09,522
And even though I love my boots 

29
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,596
This fashion's getting old. 

30
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:15,456
The time has come to welcome spring 

31
00:03:15,457 --> 00:03:17,235
And all things warm and green 

32
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:19,844
But it's also time to say goodbye 

33
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:21,723
It's winter we must clean 

34
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:24,316
How can I help? I'm new, you see 

35
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:26,065
What does everypony do? 

36
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:28,829
How do I fit in without magic? 

37
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,619
I haven't got a clue. 

38
00:03:32,263 --> 00:03:34,782
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up! 

39
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:38,899
Let's finish our holiday cheer 
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up! 

40
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,824
'cause tomorrow spring is here 
'cause tomorrow spring is here...

41
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:45,120
Bringing home the southern birds 

42
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:46,697
A pegasus's job begins 

43
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:49,194
And clearing all the gloomy skies 

44
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,830
To let the sunshine in 

45
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,580
We move the clouds 

46
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:55,068
And we melt the white snow 

47
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,413
When the sun comes up 

48
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:59,913
Its warmth and beauty will glow 

49
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:05,597
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up! 
Let's finish our holiday cheer 

50
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:14,178
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up! 
'cause tomorrow spring is here 

51
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:15,679
'cause tomorrow spring is here 

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,026
Little critters hibernate 

53
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:19,850
Under the snow and ice 

54
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:22,236
We wake up all the sleepy heads 

55
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:24,036
So quietly and nice 

56
00:04:24,437 --> 00:04:26,704
We help them gather up their food 

57
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:28,485
Fix their homes below 

58
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:31,018
We welcome back the southern birds 

59
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:33,929
So their families can grow 

60
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:38,926
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up! 
Let's finish our holiday cheer 

61
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:47,300
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up! 
'cause tomorrow spring is here 

62
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:48,928
'cause tomorrow spring is here 

63
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:51,490
No easy task to clear the ground 

64
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,411
Plant our tiny seeds 

65
00:04:53,412 --> 00:04:55,832
With proper care and sunshine 

66
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,481
Everyone it feeds 

67
00:04:57,482 --> 00:04:59,528
Apples, carrots, celery stalks 

68
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:01,414
Colorful flowers too 

69
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:03,685
We must work so very hard 

70
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:06,068
It's just so much to do 

71
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:10,768
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up! 
Let's finish our holiday cheer 

72
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:18,841
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up! 
'cause tomorrow spring is here 

73
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:20,797
'cause tomorrow spring is here 

74
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:23,376
Now that I know what they all do 

75
00:05:23,377 --> 00:05:25,780
I have to find my place 

76
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:28,533
And help with all of my heart 

77
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:30,528
Tough task ahead I face 

78
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:33,597
How will I do without my magic 

79
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:35,833
Help the earth pony way 

80
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:38,549
I want to belong so I must 

81
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,658
Do my best today 

82
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:45,463
Do my best today
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up! 

83
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:49,479
Let's finish our holiday cheer 
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up! 

84
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,480
'cause tomorrow spring is here 
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up! 

85
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:57,576
'cause tomorrow spring is here 

86
00:05:57,577 --> 00:06:03,141
'cause tomorrow spring is here!

87
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:13,841
Everypony belongs to a team. What should I do? Where should I go?

88
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:17,345
Alright team, you're clear for takeoff.

89
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:19,397
Rainbow Dash!

90
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:21,181
Oh, hey Twilight, what's up?

91
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:22,560
What are you doing?

92
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:26,361
Sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve the birds that have flown south for the winter.

93
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:30,057
Oh, can I help? How about if I help clear out the clouds?

94
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:33,890
Right. No wings.

95
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:35,610
Sorry Twilight.

96
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:40,596
Great, now what do we do?

97
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:45,156
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna be nappin'.

98
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:53,025
Come on Spike, this is serious business. Winter needs to be wrapped up, and I'm determined to do my part.

99
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:55,243
Somehow...

100
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,013
Rarity, please tell me there's something, anything I can help you with.

101
00:07:06,014 --> 00:07:10,793
Well, how would you like to help create Ponyville's finest birds' nests?

102
00:07:10,794 --> 00:07:11,994
Birds' nests?

103
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:18,512
Why yes. When the weather team guides the birds back north for the spring, they'll need a place to live and lay their eggs.

104
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:21,533
Wow Rarity, that one's really beautiful.

105
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:25,791
Oh why, thank you most sincerely. Would you like to try your hoof at a nest?

106
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:28,877
Would I? Yes! Where do I begin?

107
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:34,829
Okay. Now... uh, take some of that straw and hay over there, and a little bit of branch.

108
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:45,713
Now, weave them through there, yes. Uh, take some ribbon, yes, oh uh, n... not there, oooh, yes, uh, tuck it in over there, uh but be careful not to... 

109
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:49,369
I don't know I guess that would do... oh dear.

110
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,293
There! 
It looks just like... yours. Oh my.

111
00:07:55,294 --> 00:07:56,958
That nest needs to be condemned.

112
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:03,454
Oh, Spa-ha-hike, it's not so bad, ah, maybe birds can use it as a...

113
00:08:03,455 --> 00:08:04,655
An outhouse?

114
00:08:04,656 --> 00:08:09,586
Spike. It's just fine. It's just a little rough around the edges. 

115
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:15,981
Let me lend you a hoof. Let's just untie this ribbon, and let me take out these sticks here, we'll shave this...

116
00:08:17,724 --> 00:08:19,487
I think we lost her.

117
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:31,701
- Helooooooo Twilight! Wheeeeeeee!
- Wow Pinkie Pie, you're quite the skater. Probably the best skater I've ever seen.

118
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:37,137
Thanks Twilight, I've been doing this since I was an itty-bitty little-wittle Twinkie-Pinkie.

119
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:38,538
Just comes naturally. 

120
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:44,111
Which is probably why they designated me the lake scorer. 

121
00:08:44,112 --> 00:08:51,012
I cut lines in the lakes with my skates. That way, when the rest of the weather team comes here to break the ice, it'll be easy as pie.

122
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:55,348
How clever. When the thick ice begins to melt, it'll break along the lines. 

123
00:08:55,349 --> 00:08:59,550
Well you sure have a lot of work ahead of you, there's quite a few lakes in Ponyville.

124
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:03,416
Ha, tell me about it. Hey, Twilight, wanna help me out?

125
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:08,882
- Would I?
- Come on, put on those skates over there. I bet you'll be a natural too.

126
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:09,883
Okay. 

127
00:09:13,026 --> 00:09:15,986
Uh... maybe on second thought.

128
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:20,095
- What are you talking about? You said you wanted to be helpful.
- Yippie!

129
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,647
Now get out there.

130
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:27,582
Twilight, steer! Steer!

131
00:09:28,632 --> 00:09:30,081
Oh boy...

132
00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:45,058
Ha ha, you are a natural, Twilight. A natural disaster. 

133
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:54,516
Twilight, you did a great job your first time around. I'm sure my first time was just as wobbly and bobbly and crasheriffic as yours.

134
00:09:54,517 --> 00:09:55,517
Really?

135
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,849
No.

136
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:00,469
But did I make you feel better?

137
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,802
Mm-hmm, yeah, I guess.

138
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:10,006
I think you'll be super awesome at something that keeps your hoofs on the ground. I know, Fluttershy could probably use your help with the critters.

139
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:14,173
Well... I'm pretty good with little animals. Yeah, I'll go help her.

140
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:17,668
Uh... it's, ah, that a-way.

141
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:33,887
Wake up little sleepy heads. Hope you had some wonderful dreams and restful hibernation, but it's time to get up now, spring is coming.

142
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:39,883
Awww, how cute.

143
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:46,593
Aren't they? This is my favorite task the whole season, when I get to see all my little animal friends again.

144
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:48,970
Uh, what's "hibernation"?

145
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:51,657
It's like a long sleep.

146
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:53,451
Long sleep?

147
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,452
Yes.

148
00:10:55,883 --> 00:10:58,259
Wake up little porcupines. 

149
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:03,461
Animals often hibernate through the winter to save their energy and eat less food.

150
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:08,635
I definitely like the idea of hibernation, uh, except for the "eat less food" part.

151
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:22,814
Oh, but just look at all these warrens and dens, I'm worried that I won't be able to wake up every animal before spring comes.

152
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,356
Well, I'll help, Fluttershy.

153
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:29,206
You will? Oh, that would be wonderful.

154
00:11:29,951 --> 00:11:32,903
Okay, let's start there. 

155
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:42,707
Hello? Wake up little friends, wherever you are. Spring is coming. 

156
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,461
I wonder which cute little furry creatures I've awoken.

157
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:53,688
Waaa! Snakes! Snakes!

158
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:07,988
Good morning friends.

159
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:14,970
All this Winter Wrap Up stuff is a lot harder than it looks.

160
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:20,206
Right, because there's no magic. Why don't you just use magic, Twilight, and get it done the right way?

161
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:26,643
No, Spike, I have to do it the traditional way. Ponyville has never needed magic to wrap up winter.

162
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:32,048
Well, they never had you here before, either. Think how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.

163
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,249
No, no, no!

164
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,924
I'm gonna find some other way that I can help out if it kills me.

165
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:47,032
Keep pushin', Caramel. That's it pumpkin', I know it's hard work, but you guys are doin' great. Yee-haw!

166
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,260
Hey Applejack. How's everything going?

167
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:53,620
Oh, just dandy. Little slow startin', but peachy all the same.

168
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:59,958
 There's a lot of ground to clear ya hear. We can't even start the plantin' and the waterin' until we git all these heap a' snow high-tailed outta here.

169
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,139
Well, I'd like to help.

170
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:06,680
- Well, I... I dunno Twilight.
- Just give me a chance!

171
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:09,487
Well, I never turn down a hard worker but... 

172
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,974
Think of how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.

173
00:13:29,512 --> 00:13:36,577
I could use a come-to-life spell. Hwww... Here goes...

174
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:54,648
Hmm. She's awful strong for such a little pony.

175
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:04,216
- That's my girl, following my advice.
- And what in tarnation does that mean?

176
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:10,472
Uh oh. Slow down. Slow down!

177
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:32,039
What's going on? Wha'd'ya do? You used magic, didn't you? 

178
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:58,584
- Nuts Twilight, you used magic.
- The nerve. Can you believe her?

179
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:05,292
That's not how we do it 'round here, Twilight, and especially not on MAH farm.

180
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:09,044
Well, see, I just wanted to...

181
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:25,013
Come on, Twilight. Come on out.

182
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:27,363
I'm a winter mess up.

183
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:34,373
Well you're good at a lot of things, just not nest-making, ice-skating, animal-waking, snow-clearing.

184
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:38,407
Thanks a lot for making me feel so much better.

185
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:40,647
That's what I'm here for, sister.

186
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:46,460
Rainbow Dash, y'all on the weather team need to melt the rest of the snow here on the ground and the trees, pronto.

187
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:52,100
- Got it.
- Wait. My poor little animals' homes will get flooded if the snow melts too fast.

188
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:56,396
- Got it.
- I'm tellin' you Rainbow, you gotta melt that snow now.

189
00:15:56,397 --> 00:15:59,109
No, you simply must wait.

190
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,112
- Okay.
- Go.

191
00:16:01,113 --> 00:16:06,143
- Stop!
- Go!

192
00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:08,044
Ugh! Make up your minds!

193
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:12,189
Oh! What in Equestria are all you arguing about? 

194
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:18,384
This sort of silliness is why we were late for spring last year, and the year before that, and the year before that.

195
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:20,428
Did she say late?

196
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:25,415
I was hoping my amazingly inspirational speech would urge everyone to do better than last year

197
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,798
but now it looks like we're going to be later than ever.

198
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,981
I mean just look at this catastrophe. The ice scorers made the ice chunks too big to melt;

199
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:39,771
the nest designer is horrendously behind, we need several hundred, and she's only made one;

200
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:48,253
And don't get me started on all the clouds in the sky, the icicles on the trees... This isn't good, not at all!

201
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:52,492
And it's gonna be all to pieces disastrous if we can't get our seeds all planted.

202
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:56,363
Chillax Applejack, we're bustin' our chops as fast as we can.

203
00:16:56,364 --> 00:17:00,660
No, not fast, we have to wake animals slowly.

204
00:17:00,661 --> 00:17:02,823
Uh, AJ?

205
00:17:02,824 --> 00:17:07,095
Oh good gravy, Caramel lost the grass seeds again, didn't he?

206
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:08,096
Ai-yup.

207
00:17:09,114 --> 00:17:13,587
Ditzy Doo accidentally went north to get the southern birds!

208
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:18,196
Oh that featherbrain. Didn't she learn her lesson last year when she went west?

209
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:25,203
Stop this at once. We don't have time to argue. 

210
00:17:25,204 --> 00:17:28,714
It's almost sundown. Spring is going to be late again. 

211
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:34,848
Another year of scandal and shame. If only we could be more organized.

212
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:38,586
Spike! Get my checklist and clipboard, STAT!

213
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:39,587
Yes ma'am.

214
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:41,388
Stop everypony.

215
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:44,643
Stop.

216
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:49,885
Sorry. 

217
00:17:50,576 --> 00:17:57,277
I know you all want to complete your jobs on time, but arguing is no way to go about it. What you need is...

218
00:17:57,478 --> 00:18:01,996
organization. And I'm just the pony for the job. 

219
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:18,702
I can't believe it. Spring is here! On time! 

220
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:25,843
- And we have you to thank for it. If it weren't for your organizing skills we would still be arguing.
- Ai-yup.

221
00:20:28,524 --> 00:20:30,084
It was a team effort.

222
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:38,525
And since you helped every team, we have an official vest for you. We give you the title, "All-Team Organizer".

223
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:43,653
Gosh, I don't even know what to say. Thank you everypony.

224
00:20:43,654 --> 00:20:49,792
And hereby I declare that winter is... wrapped up on time.

225
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:56,576
Spike's sure gonna be in for a hog-sized surprised when that last piece a' ice melts.

226
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:03,089
Dear Princess Celestia,

227
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,776
Winter Wrap Up was one of the most special things I've ever been a part of here in Ponyville.

228
00:21:07,777 --> 00:21:14,284
It helped me to learn we all have hidden talents, and if we're patient and diligent, we're sure to find them

229
00:21:14,285 --> 00:21:19,163
and as always, with good friendship and teamwork, ponies can accomplish anything. 

230
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:22,344
How's that, Spike? Spike?

231
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:27,770
Oh, Spike.
