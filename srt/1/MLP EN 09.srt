1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,680
Wow, what a gorgeous day.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,520
Rainbow Dash must have got up early for once and cleared all the clouds away.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,320
I bet all in Ponyville is got to be out enjoying the sunshine.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,960
What? Where is everypony?

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,300
Is it some sort of pony holiday?

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,600
Not that I know of.

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,580
Does my breath stink?

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,300
Not more than usual.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,640
Is it... zombies?!

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,170
Nuh-uh... Not very likely.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,410
Not likely, but possible?

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,640
*whispering* Pssst...

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,470
Twilight!

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,410
Spike! Come here!

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,610
Come! Here!

16
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,290
Hurry, before she gets you!

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,280
Uh, who? The zombie pony?

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,700
Zombie pony??

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,340
Spike, there are no zombie ponies.

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,210
Pinkie, what are you doing here alone in the dark?

21
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,890
I'm not alone in the dark.

22
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,650
Okay then, what are you all doing here in the dark?

23
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,470
We're hiding from HER.

24
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,280
Did you see her, Twilight? Did you see Zecora?

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,920
Applebloom. I told you never to say that name.

26
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,190
Well, I saw her glance this way.

27
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,170
Glance eeeevilly this way.

28
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,890
And then a bunch of you flip out for no good reason.

29
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,670
No good reason?!

30
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,240
You called protecting your kin "no good reason"?

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,630
While as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town,

32
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,970
she's started shaking in her little horse-shoes.

33
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,910
D.i.d. .n.o.t.

34
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,070
So I swept

35
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,890
I walked here myself!

36
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,080
For safe keep.

37
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,250
Applejack! I'm not a baby. I can take care of myself.

38
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,520
Not from that creepy Zecora.

39
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,460
She's mysterious.

40
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,950
Sinister.

41
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,890
And spooooooky.

42
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,230
Will you cut that out?!

43
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,290
Just look at those stripes! So garish.

44
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,150
She's a zebra.

45
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,670
A what?!

46
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,470
A zebra. And her stripes aren't a fashion choice, Rarity.

47
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,070
They're what she was born with.

48
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,840
Born weird. I never seen a pony like that in this parts,

49
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,510
except HER.

50
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,830
Well, she's probably not from here. And she's not a pony.

51
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,800
My book say that zebras come from a far away land.

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,230
But I've never seen her in Ponyville. Where does she live?

53
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,740
That's just it. She lives in the Everfree Forest!

54
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,600
Spike!

55
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,130
Eh. Sorry.

56
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,400
The Everfree Forest just ain't natural,

57
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,890
the plants grow,

58
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,090
animals care for themselves,

59
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,140
and the clouds move

60
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,370
ALL ON THEIR OWN!

61
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,180
And that wicked Enchantress, Zecora, lives there doing her evil... stuff!

62
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,600
Oh, she's so evil, I even wrote a song about her.

63
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,010
Here we go...

64
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,500
She's an evil enchantress

65
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,840
And she does evil dances

66
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,250
And if you look deep in her eyes

67
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,670
She will put you in trances

68
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,900
Then what will she do?

69
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,380
She'll mix up an evil brew

70
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,650
And she'll gobble you up

71
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,800
In a big tasty stew

72
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,030
So... watch out!

73
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,460
Wow... Catchy.

74
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,430
It's a work-in-progress.

75
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,700
This is all just a lot of gossip and rumors.

76
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,540
Now tell me, what exactly have you actually seen Zecora do?

77
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,660
Well...

78
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,010
Once a month... she comes into Ponyville.

79
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,160
Ooooh...

80
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,070
Then... she lurks by the stores...

81
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,890
Oh my!

82
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,090
And then... she digs at the ground.

83
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,180
Good gracious!

84
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,600
OK. I'm sorry... But how is any of this bad?

85
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,910
Maybe she comes to town to visit?

86
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,550
Yeah. Maybe she's just trying to be neighborly.

87
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,650
And maybe she's not lurking by the stores. Maybe she's going to them,

88
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,770
lurk free, to do some shopping.

89
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,450
Yeah. Everypony likes to shop. You know what I think?

90
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,870
Apple Bloom! Hush and let the big ponies talk.

91
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,140
I am a big pony...

92
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,980
What about digging at the ground? You got to admit - that's weird.

93
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,330
What if she's digging for innocent creatures?

94
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,570
*Pinkie Pie singing in the background*
I'm sure there is an explanation for everything Zecora does.

95
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,780
And if anypony here were actually brave enough to approach her, she would find out the truth.

96
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,610
Well, I'm brave enough. I'm gonna find out myself.

97
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,880
You ponies are being ridiculous.

98
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,670
Well, I heard that Zecora... eats hay.

99
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:53,100
Pinkie, I eat hay, you eat hay!

100
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,630
Yeah... But I heard it's the eeeevil way she eats hay...

101
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,870
Hey! Where's Applebloom?

102
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,880
The door's open!

103
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,360
She went outside!

104
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,900
And Zecora's still out there!

105
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,390
That silly little filly. I've told her to stay put!

106
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,600
Spike, you stay here in case Applebloom comes back.

107
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,270
Will do!

108
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,280
Applebloom?!

109
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,710
You get back here right now!

110
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,730
Beware! Beware, you ponyfolk!

111
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,260
Those leaves of blue are not a joke!

112
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,500
Y-You keep your creepy mumbo-jumbo to yourself, you hear?

113
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,880
Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!

114
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,750
[gobble you up in a big tasty stew]

115
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,130
Oh, brother...

116
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,630
Beware! Beware!

117
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,540
Yeah. Bat catch you Zecora. You and your lame curse are the ones who better beware.

118
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,190
And you! Why couldn't you just listen to your big sister?

119
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,640
I-I...

120
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,700
Who knows what kind of nasty curse Zecora could've just put on you?

121
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,260
Just like in my song!

122
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,790
[...evil enchantress and ... evil dances...]

123
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,200
[..and the trances]

124
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,770
You guys, there's no such thing as curses!

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,610
Well, that's interesting to hear coming from this magic pants herself.

126
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,150
My magic, real magic, comes from within. It's a skill you're born with,

127
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,530
Curses are artificial, fake magic.

128
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:41,070
It's counter with potions and incantations, while all smoke and mirrors meant to scare.

129
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,690
But curses have no real power. They're just an old pony tale.

130
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,100
Just you wait, Twilight.

131
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,610
You're gonna learn that some pony tales really are true.

132
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,430
[She's an evil enchantress and she does evil dances]

133
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,300
[Beware! Beware!]

134
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,280
[And if you look deep in her eyes she will put you in trances]

135
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,740
[Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!]

136
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,970

[Then what will she do?]

139
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,300
[Just you wait, Twilight... some pony tales really are true.]

[So... WATCH OUT!  *MWAHAHAA*]

142
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,190
Ohh... What a dream.

143
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,940
Curses-shmurses.

144
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,890
Wow. Heh. Maybe Zecora cursed my hair... he-he.

145
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,960
Or she cursed my horn!

146
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,340
No, no, no, No, NO!

147
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,570
None of these books have a cure!

148
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,840
There has to be a real reason for this.

149
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,080
An illness? An allergy?

150
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,600
A curse!

151
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,090
I said a real reason.

152
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,440
Something that points to something real.

153
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,930
How about this one?

154
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,350
Supernaturals?

155
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:13,300
Spike, the word supernatural refers to things like ghosts and spirits and zombies.

156
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,280
Which are as make-believe as curses! This books is just a bunch of hooey!

157
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,260
But what if you're wrong, Twilight? What if this really is a...

158
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,790
*a a truth!*

159
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,360
A purse? How could it be a purse?

160
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,700

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,460
She's... trying to say *ouch*

166
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,380
Zecora... she slabbed us all with a... curse!

167
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,460
I'm afraid I have to agree.

168
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,270
I hate to say I told you so, Twilight, but I told you so.

169
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,550
It's a curse I tells ya.

170
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,600
But Fluttershy seems just fine.

171
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,060
Yes, there doesn't seem to be a thing wrong with her.

172
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,370
Fluttershy, are you okay?

173
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,310
Is there something wrong with you?

174
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,140
Would you care to tell us?

175
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,860
So, you're not gonna tell us?

176
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,030
Yes - you're not, or yes - you will?

177
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,490
Good greaty, girl. What's wrong with you?

178
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,690
*deep low voice*
I don't wanna talk about it.

179
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,940
This is hilarious! Look at all of you. We got:

180
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,840
"Hair"-ity,

181
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,330
Rainbow "Crash",

182
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,780
"Spitty" Pie,

183
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,010
Apple-"tini",

184
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,490
Flutter-"guy" and...

185
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,620
eh... I got nothing.

186
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,270
"Twilight Sparkle"... I mean, seriously, I can't even work with that.

187
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,840
Ha-ha-ha. This is no joke, Spike.

188
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,740
Now start looking for more books so I can find the cure.

189
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,160
I think we'll find the cure to this curse at Zecora's place.

190
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,500
It's not a curse.

191
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:07,860
I agree with Dash. We'll go to Zecora's and force her to remove this hex.

192
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,980
It's not a hex, either!

193
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,770
This is all my fault. If I hadn't followed Zecora in the first place, none of this would've happen.

194
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,410
I just got to fix this.

195
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,140
Now where does she think she's going this time?

196
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:34,770
I don't care what you say, Twilight. It's time to 'pony up', and confront Zecora! Come on, girls.

197
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,780
Are you with me?

198
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,970
*ayathpf*

199
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,380
And I as well.

200
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,630
I-I don't know. Seems awfully dangerous.

201
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,120
How about you, Applejack?

202
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,730
Applejack?

203
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,620
*shfe'f gonpf*

204
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,680
Or somepony stepped on her?

205
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,510
Or sat on her?..

206
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,450
Rarity's hair!

207
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,660
Ow, aw! Pinkie?! What are you doing?!

208
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,370
Really! Did you hear of personal space?

209
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,900
*nopf*

210
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,690
Applebloom is gone too!

211
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,810
I bet they went after Zecora.

212
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,440
Well, we better go find them.

213
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,900
Come on, girls. Let's go.

214
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,580
Oh, dear.

215
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,260
Oh, this is so unseemly.

216
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,230
Hey! A little help here.

217
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,880
Oopsie. Sorry.

218
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,330
Eeemm... S-Spike? Are you coming?

219
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,980
Nope. Em. Got to stay here and look for a cure.

220
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,470
Oh! "Twilight Flopple"!

221
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,730
Stop right there.

222
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,890
Turn around right now, missy.

223
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,940
No.

224
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,260
No?! You can't ignore a direct order from your big sister.

225
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,260
Sorry, Applejack, but I'm the big sister now.

226
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,790
Applebloom, you come back here right this instant!

227
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,990
I'm gonna tell Big Macintosh on you!

228
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,120
Ow, pony feathers.

229
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,780
Come on, girls. We've got to get to Zecora's. Hurry!

230
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,690
Easier said than done.

231
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,080
Hey! Wait for me!

232
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,830
Rainbow! Thanks Celestia. There's no time to lose!

233
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,830
I need to get to Zecora's pronto.

234
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,320
Get it up, pony!

235
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,740
Eexcuuuseee me?!

236
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,270
*YEEEHAWW*

237
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,640
What tha?!

238
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,140
No, Rainbow Dash, the other way!

239
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,330
Ew, I look horrible!

240
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,680
*thithp pflapth lopth horipfl*

241
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,030
Oh, my. That place really does look horrible.

242
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,900
Nice decorations.

243
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,350
If you like creepy.

244
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,250
*pth spththe mithn! pth spththe mithn!*

245
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,150
She stole your song?

246
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,720
No, Pinky, doesn't sound anything like your song.

247
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,970
She's an evil enchantress and she does evil dances

248
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,510
And if you look deep in her eyes she will put you in trances

249
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,010
Then what will she do? She'll mix up an evil brew

250
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,620
And she'll gobble you up in a big tasty stew

251
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,150
So... watch out.

252
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,470
You saw those terrible things. Now you believe us, Twilight?

253
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,990
Scary-looking masks, confusing incantations and a great big bubbling cauldron?

254
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,340
Oh... Everything is pointing to Zecora being... bad.

255
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,660
Or... What if Zecora's just making soup?

256
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:32,990
Um... The perfect temperature for ponies, I presume. Now ....

257
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,300
where is that little Appleboom?

258
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,250
Or...  What if she's making Appleboom soup?!

259
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,110
What if she's making Appleboom soup?!

260
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,550
I'm coming for ya, Applebloom!

261
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,180
Wow there! Easy Rainbow Crash.

262
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,990
What have you done with Appleboom?!

263
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,700
No! No!

264
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,560
Ponies, what is this you do?

265
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,990
No! You know not what you do.

266
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,890
You've gone and spilled my precious brew!

267
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:36,320
We're on to you, Zecora. I did not want to believe that you've cursed us. But the evidence is overwhelming.

268
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,520
You made me look ridiculous.

269
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,790
You made me sound ridiculous.

270
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,770
***You made my tongue ridiculous!***

271
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,550
You ruined my horn!

272
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,270
How dare you?!

273
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,210
You destroy my home, destroy my work.

274
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,180
Then rudely accuse me of being a jerk?!

275
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,080
You've put this curse on us!

276
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,790
Now you're gonna uncurse us.

277
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,850
It is unwise to be into down this road.

278
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,860
Your actions will make my anger explode!

279
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,360
Where is Applebloom?

280
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,670
Zecora, I think I found all the things you've asked for.

281
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,100
What in Ponyvile is going on here?!

282
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,600
Applebloom! You're okay!

283
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,680
Why wouldn't I be?

284
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,960
Because Zecora is an evil Enchantress who cursed us and was gonna cook you up in a soup!

285
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,790
Ha-ha. Oh, Twilight.

286
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,730
Did those silly fillies finally get into your head?

287
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,110
You know there's no such thing as a curse.

288
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:35,760
Applebloom, sweetie, you can't just stand there and tell me this isn't a curse.

289
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,740
This isn't a curse.

290
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,560
If you will remember back.

291
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,280
The words I spoke were quite exact.

292
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,930
Beware! Beware, you ponyfolk.

293
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,160
Those leaves of blue are not a joke.

294
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,060
It was a warning.

295
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,660
About that blue plant.

296
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,670
It's called "poison joke".

297
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,460
That plant is much like poison oak.

298
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,140
But it's results are like a joke.

299
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,600
What in a hay does that mean?

300
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,620
It means this plant does not breed wrath,

301
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,780
Instead this plant just wants a laugh.

302
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,240
Will somepony please talk normal.

303
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,490
I think what she's saying is that when we ran into save Appleboom, we ran into the "poison joke".

304
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,810
All our problems are just little jokes it played on us.

305
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,260
Little jokes?!

306
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,560
Very funny.

307
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,760
Okay, fine. But what about the cauldron?

308
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,360
And the chanting?

309
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,850
And the creepy decor?

310
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,570
Treasures of the native land where I am from.

311
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,700
This one speaks "hello",

312
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,820
and this "welcome".

313
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,680
Not welcoming at all, if you ask me.

314
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,510
The words I chanted were from olden times.

315
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,890
Something you call a nursery rhyme.

316
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,950
But the cauldron? The Applebloom soup?

317
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,380
Looky here, Twilight. That part of water was not for me.

318
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,500
It was for all these herbal ingredients.

319
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,030
The cure for "poison joke" is a simple all-natural remedy.

320
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,420
You just got to take a bubble bath.

321
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,430
But I tried to find a cure in all my books and couldn't find anything.

322
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,930
What book has this natural remedy?

323
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,460
Here is the book, you see?

324
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,400
Sad that you lack it in your library.

325
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,560
Actually, I do have this book.

326
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,140
But I did not look inside because the title was so... weird.

327
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,060
Supernaturals. Natural remedies and cure-alls that are simply super.

328
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,930
I... I... I'm so sorry Zecora.

329
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,470
I had the answer the whole time, if only I bother to look inside...

330
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,410
Ha-ha-ha. Maybe next time you will take a second look,

331
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,240
and not judge the cover of the book.

332
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:47,680
Zecora, would you be kind enough to mix up another batch of the herbal bath?

333
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,130
Mix it up I certainly will.

334
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,630
Yet I'm missing an herb from Ponyvile.

335
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:58,280
Whenever Zecora comes to town all the shops are mysteriously closed.

336
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,970
Oh, well, I think we can help you with that.

337
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,810
Look, Rose! How awful!

338
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,530
The wicked Enchantress has cursed them all!

339
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,620
The horror! The horror!

340
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,280
Run, ponies! Run!

341
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,190
Daisy, we need to talk.

342
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,540
Dear princess Celestia,

343
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,010
My friends and I all learned an important lesson this week.

344
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,940
Never judge the book by it's cover.

345
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:40,570
Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary, but you have to look past that and learn what they are inside.

346
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:45,480
Real friends don't care what your cover is, it's the contents of a pony that count.

347
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,570
And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever.

348
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,510
Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.

349
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,310
Miss Zecora, I would love to get a receipt for this bath.

350
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,660
It simply luxurious.

351
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,380
Applejack! Hey! Where is Applejack?

352
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,290
I'm right here, LITTLE sis.

353
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,150
I ain't tiny no more!

354
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:14,550
Oh... I have never felt so lovely in all my life!

355
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,680
Oh my gosh! I never realized how horrible is not to be able to talk!

356
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,800
I mean I love talking so much but I can't
talk anymore when my tongue was all *bleh*

357
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,930
It was the worst, don't you agree, Fluttershy?

358
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,350
Yes.
