1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,380
Now, what have we learned?

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,220
- Lots of control.
- Good.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,160
- Screaming and hollering.
- Yes, and most importantly?

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,930
- Passion!
- Right!

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,310
So now that you know the elements of a good cheer, let's hear one.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,480
Yay.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,400
You're gonna cheer for me like that? Louder.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,070
Yay.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,540
- Louder!
- Yay.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,600
LOUDER!

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,940
Yay.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,130
Too loud?

13
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,250
Yay.

14
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,430
And now, phase one of my routine.

15
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,730
Phase two.

16
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,580
Way to go.

17
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,190
Here we go. Phase three. The Sonic Rainboom.

18
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,480
Last one.

19
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,480
Thank you so much for helping me clean up all these books guys.

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,550
It was a crazy week of studying.

21
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,290
Rainbow Dash, you rock!

22
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,670
Did my cheering do that?

23
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,980
Sorry about that ladies. That was a truly feeble performance.

24
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,000
Actually, it wasn't all bad. I particularly liked it when you made the clouds spin.

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,820
I'm not talking about my performance, I'm talking about yours. That feeble cheering!

26
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,450
What are you two arguing about?

27
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,140
Were we arguing? I'm sorry.

28
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,450
I wish you guys could come to Cloudsdale to see me compete in the Best Young Flyer Competition.

29
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,700
What's that?

30
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,580
It's where all the greatest pegasus flyers get together and show off their different flying styles!

31
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,580
Some are fast!

32
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,380
And some are graceful.

33
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,920
Golly. I'd love to see you strut yer stuff in that competition.

34
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,250
Yeah. I wish you guys could be there. Fluttershy's a great support, but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational.

35
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,910
I'd love to see you make a Sonic Rainboom! It's like, the most coolest thing ever!

36
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:37,210
Even though I've never actually seen it, but I mean COME ON! It's a Sonic Rainboom! How not cool could it possibly not be?!

37
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,350
What's a Sonic Rainboom?

38
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,520
You really need to get out more.

39
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,730
The Sonic Rainboom is legendary! When a pegasus like Rainbow Dash gets going soo fast...

40
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,950
A sonic boom and a rainbow can happen all at once!

41
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,470
And Rainbow Dash here's the only pony to ever pull it off!

42
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,720
It was a long time ago... I was just a filly.

43
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,510
Yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right?

44
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:09,190
Are... you kidding? I'm the greatest flyer to ever come out of Cloudsdale! I could do Sonic Rainbooms in my sleep.

45
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,860
If you pull that off, you'll win the crown for sure!

46
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,290
The grand prize is an entire day with the Wonderbolts.

47
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,890
A whole day of flying with my life-long heroes... It'll be a dream come true!

48
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,890
Yay.

49
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,880
I'm gonna go rest up. Don't wanna over prepare myself, y'know. Hehe.

50
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,560
YOU, on the other hand, better keep practicing.

51
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,930
I need a cheering section to match my spectacular performance.

52
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,030
She's practiced that move a hundred times, and she's never even come close to doing it.

53
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,490
I don't know if I can cheer loud enough to help her.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,140
Well, guess we better get this cleaned up... Again.

55
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,390
Go on, go on.

56
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,350
Go on what?

57
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:01,160
Find a spell that will get us wingless ponies into Cloudsdale. Didn't you see how nervous she was?

58
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,900
Nervous? Have you spit yer bit or somethin'? She was tootin' her own horn louder then the brass section of a marching band!

59
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,470
Oh, puh-lease. I have put on enough fashion shows to recognize stage fright when I see it.

60
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,370
We've got to find a way to be there for her. Now go on!

61
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,800
How am I supposed to find a flight spell in this mess?

62
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,050
A flight spell? One sec.

63
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,880
Page twenty-seven.

64
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,920
How'd you do that?

65
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,580
It landed on my face when Rainbow Dash knocked me into the bookcase.

66
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,970
Here it is! A spell that will allow earth ponies to fly for three days.

67
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,910
It looks really difficult... I'm not sure I can do it.

68
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,780
You've got to try!

69
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,820
Ok... But who's gonna volunteer to be the test subject?

70
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,170
I will! For Rainbow Dash, I will go first.

71
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,170
Here goes.

72
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,530
I think it worked!

73
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,110
You've got to learn to be assertive, Fluttershy. Don't be afraid to speak up.

74
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,780
Well well well. What do we have here?

75
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,770
It's our old friend, Rainbow Crash!

76
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,180
Get kicked outta any flight schools lately?

77
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,150
I didn't get kicked out.

78
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:48,630
Face it, Rainbow Crash. Flight school had too many rules, and not enough naptimes for you.

79
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,130
Ask her about the Sonic Rainboom.

80
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:57,210
That's nothing but an old mare's tale. You don't have the skills to try something like that.

81
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,790
Now wait just a minute!

82
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,040
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm trying to be more assertive.

83
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,080
Anyhow... She is going to do a Sonic Rainboom!

84
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,850
No she's not, 'cause there's no such thing!

85
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,100
Then show up at the cloudasium and see for yourself!..

86
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,800
If you're free.

87
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,590
Yeah, I'll be free.

88
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,650
Oh, don't worry. We'll be there!

89
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,470
See you then, Rainbow Crash!

90
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,410
Did you see that? I was so assertive!

91
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,980
Those guys are right. I'll never be able to do it.

92
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:34,140
But Rainbow Dash. Just because you've failed the Sonic Rainboom a hundred thousand times in practice

93
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,810
doesn't mean you won't be able to do it in front of an entire stadium, full of impatient,

94
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,990
super-critical sportsfan ponies.

95
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,080
What do I do?! Every pony's gonna see me fail! The Wonderbolts will never let a loser like me join.

96
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,180
Princess Celestia will probably banish me to the Everfree Forest!

97
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,080
MY LIFE IS RUINED!!

98
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,540
Rare...

99
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,180
Rare?! The Sonic Rainboom is WAY more than rare!

100
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,450
Rarity?

101
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,970
Rarity! Are you... flying?!

102
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:15,390
I most certainly am! Aren't my wings smashing?! Twilight made them for me. I just adore them!

103
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:21,670
Why so shocked? We couldn't leave our favorite flyer without a big cheering section!

104
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,670
We?

105
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,980
I... I can't believe it!

106
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,760
It's incredible!

107
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,310
This is so cool! You guys made it!

108
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,380
- Sure did!
- WAIT!

109
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,340
How'd you do that? Only pegasus ponies can walk on clouds.

110
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,860
Pretty cool, huh?

111
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,720
I found a spell that makes temporary wings, but it was too difficult to do more than once.

112
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,240
So I found an easier spell that lets the rest of us walk on clouds.

113
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,430
And we came to cheer you to victory!

114
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:04,470
To be honest, I was starting to get just a tiniest, tinyest bit nervous.

115
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,020
But I feel a LOT better now that you guys are here.

116
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,180
Hey, we've got some time before the competition. Why don't Fluttershy and I show you around Cloudsdale?

117
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,320
Here it is: the greatest city in the sky!

118
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,800
Some of the greatest pegasi in history came from Clousdale!

119
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,460
Wait for me!

120
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,280
Those wings are gorgeous!

121
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Why, thank you!

122
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:51,300
Be careful with those wings Rarity. They're made from gossamer and morning dew, and they're incredibly delicate.

123
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,430
Don't worry Twilight. I'm sure they can't get worn out from too much attention?

124
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,170
Since we're up here, I'd shure like to get a look at where the weather's made.

125
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,680
Great idea! C'mon girls. To the weather factory!

126
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:16,700
This is where they make the snowflakes. Each one is hoofmade. As you can see, it's a delicate operation.

127
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,260
The snowflakes look even better from up here.

128
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,490
We better move on before Rarity ruins winter and causes a drought.

129
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,490
And here's where they make the rainbows!

130
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,150
Spicyyyyyy!

131
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,350
Yeah, rainbows aren't really known for their flavor.

132
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,660
Where'd you get those amazing wings? I want a pair!

133
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,850
Yeah, I guess I could see that.

134
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,200
Oh hey look, it's Rainbow Crash again!

135
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,890
Yeah! Rainbow... Umm...

136
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,970
Crash!

137
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,610
Rarity! What're you doing talking to these guys?

138
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,640
Oh, they were just admiring my wings Rainbow Dash.

139
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,020
Yeah, you should forget the Sonic Rainboom and just get yourself some wings like these!

140
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,270
C'mon girls. Why don't we go see how clouds are made? 

141
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,340
Don't listen to them. You're gonna win that competition for sure!

142
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,190
Are you kidding? I can't DO the Sonic Rainboom, 

143
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:44,420
and just look at these boring, plain old feathered wings. I'm doomed! 

144
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:03,120
Why, these old things? Go ahead everypony. Photos are encouraged.

145
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,090
Rarity. We're supposed to be helping Rainbow Dash relax, remember? 

146
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,610
Put your wings away and stop showing off!

147
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,600
How can you ask me to put away perfection?

148
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,460
Rainbow Dash. Are you ok? You don't look so good.

149
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,780
Of course! Why wouldn't I be ok? 

150
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,560
Everyone's so in love with Rarity's wings 

151
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,010
that they won't even notice when I totally blow it in the Best Young Flyer's Competition.

152
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,580
There's an idea! YOU should enter the competition!

153
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,620
Yeah! I could watch you fly all day long!

154
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:48,590
There really isn't anypony who uses their wings quite like me. Perhaps I should compete.

155
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,410
WHAT?!

156
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,960
What am I gonna DO?! I'll never win the competition now... 

157
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,290
I'm going to be awhile!

158
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:38,660
Fillies and gentlecolts! Please rise and join me in welcoming our beloved Princess Celestia!

159
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:51,850
Please welcome our celebrity judges for the Best Young Flyer Competition. The Wonderbolts!

160
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:10,680
And, let's find out who will take the prize as this year's best young flyer!

161
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,090
Ok contestant number one, you're up.

162
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,060
Ok number two, let's go.

163
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,770
C'mon c'mon, we ain't got all day!

164
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,360
She's talking to you!

165
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,450
Oh I guess that's me!

166
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,420
Ok number four, time to go.

167
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,980
I'm number four, and I need just one more itsy-bitsy minute. 

168
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,150
Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hmm?

169
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,130
Look, I don't care who it is, but somepony's gotta go on!

170
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,130
Let's DO THIS!

171
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,730
What am I gonna do? 

172
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,350
I loved number seven. Doing fifteen barrel-rolls in a row can't be easy.

173
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,960
My favorite is number ten. She just looked like such a nice pony.

174
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,210
Wonder how come we haven't seen Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet? The competition's almost over.

175
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,890
Number fifteen, let's go!

176
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,360
Rarity... Is ready!

177
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,290
Look ladies. I don't know what to tell you. There's only time for one more performance. 

178
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,200
If you both want to compete, you'll just have to go out there together!

179
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,830
Well Rainbow Dash? Shall we?

180
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:39,400
And now, for our final competitor of the day, contestant number fifteen!! 

181
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,860
Uhh... And apparently contestant number four...

182
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,290
Good luck Rainbow Dash. Just do your best. 

183
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,680
I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of changing our music. 

184
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,240
That "rock and roll" doesn't really match my wings.

185
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,360
C'mon Rainbow Dash. You can do this. Just remember the routine. Phase one.

186
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,600
Nice work Rainbow Crash!

187
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,990
Time for phase two.

188
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,020
Look! Phase two is working. 

189
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,120
And now for my grand finale. 

190
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,240
I will fly right up to the sun and beam my beautiful wings over the whole city of Cloudsdale! 

191
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,340
They'll be talking about it for years!

192
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,510
Looks like this is my last chance to turn things around. 

193
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,910
Phase three. The Sonic... Rainboom. 

194
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,880
Wings, don't fail me now!

195
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,330
Look upon me Equestria, for I Am Rarity!

196
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,860
Oh no! Her wings evaporated into thin air!

197
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,220
Hold on Rarity! I'm coming!

198
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,030
I can't look!

199
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:37,710
A SONIC RAINBOOM!! SHE DID IT! SHE DID IT!! WOOOOOO!!!!

200
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,310
A SONIC RAINBOOM!! WOOOOOO!!!! YEAH!!!!!

201
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,540
I did it. I did it!

202
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,960
You sure did. Oh thank you Rainbow Dash. You saved my life!

203
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,170
Oh yeah. I did that too. 

204
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,030
BEST DAY EVER! 

205
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:30,280
I want to apologize to all of you for getting so carried away with my... beautiful wings. I guess I just lost my head.

206
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,880
- It's ok.
- Don't worry about it kiddo.
- We still love you.

207
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,420
And I'm especially sorry that I was so thoughtless as to jump into the contest at the last minute 

208
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,920
after you had worked so hard to win it. Can you ever ever forgive me?

209
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,190
Aw, it's ok. Everything turned out alright, right? 

210
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,200
I just wish I could have met the Wonderbolts when they were awake.

211
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,030
OhmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohMYGOSH!

212
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:58,390
So you're the little pony who saved our lives. We really wanted to meet you, and say thanks.

213
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,890
OhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygosh!

214
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,500
Princess.

215
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,450
Hello Twilight Sparkle, and hello to your friends too.

216
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:16,400
Princess Celestia, I am sorry I ruined the competition. Rainbow Dash here really is the best flyer in Equestria.

217
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,120
I know she is my dear. 

218
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,510
That's why for her incredible act of bravery, and her spectacular Sonic Rainboom, 

219
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:30,470
I'm presenting the grand prize for best young flyer to this year's winner, Miss Rainbow Dash!

220
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,310
OhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOHMYGOSHOHMYGOSHOHMYGOSH!

221
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,870
So Twilight Sparkle, did you learn anything about friendship from this experience?

222
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,200
I did Princess, but I think Rarity learned even more than me.

223
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:51,300
I certainly did. I learned how important it is to keep your hooves on the ground, and be there for your friends.

224
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,170
Excellent. Well done Rarity. 

225
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,900
This really is the BEST DAY EVER!

226
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,430
- Uhh, hey Rainbow Crash.
- Dash!

227
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,080
Sorry Rainbow Dash. Uhh, we just wanted to congratulate you on winning the competition.

228
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,600
That Sonic Rainboom was awesome!

229
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,580
Thanks guys.

230
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,000
Uhh, we're really sorry we gave you such a hard time before.

231
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,450
Aww, that's ok. Don't worry about it.

232
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,210
You wanna hang out with us? Maybe you could show us how you did that incredible trick!

233
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,210
Sorry boys.

234
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,630
But I've got plans!
