1
00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:09,347
Ahh! I... can't... believe... the Grand... Galloping... Gala... is... tonight!

2
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:13,661
Pinkie! Please stop shouting, I'm trying to concentrate.

3
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:20,972
Pinkie Pie! Stop that right now. It's time to prepare for the Gala and I refuse to let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty.

4
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:30,649
- What's Twilight doing?
- She's got an awesome magic spell she's been working on for the Gala.

5
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,435
Where are the others? It's getting late.

6
00:00:32,436 --> 00:00:34,671
Hold your horses, girl. We're here.

7
00:00:34,972 --> 00:00:36,557
Perfect! I'm ready.

8
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:37,697
For what?

9
00:00:37,698 --> 00:00:38,898
All right, Spike.

10
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:41,864
An apple! Are we having pie?

11
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:43,065
Shh! Watch!

12
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:51,549
*Oh! Wow! Lovely!*

13
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,933
Thanks. But that's just the start. Fluttershy, did you bring your friends?
- Yes.

14
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:59,144
Will they be safe, Twilight?

15
00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:00,833
You have my word.

16
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:07,338
Ta-da!

17
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:16,862
Neat, huh? And don't worry. They'll be mice again at midnight.

18
00:01:16,863 --> 00:01:17,863
Opalescence, no!

19
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:27,300
Wait! Come back! Those horses were supposed to pull our carriage. How will we get to the Gala?

20
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:30,239
What ever shall we do?

21
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,371
Uh... ahem. Excuse me. Uh, would you boys mind pulling our carriage to the Gala?

22
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,422
Oh. Yeah. Right.

23
00:02:26,734 --> 00:02:30,250
Come on, you guys. Let me in!

24
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:31,351
Sure thing, Spike.

25
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,988
Heavens no! We're getting dressed.

26
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,348
Dressed? Uh, beg pardon, Rarity, but, uh... we don't normally wear clothes.

27
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:44,207
I'm sorry, Spike. Some of us do have standards.

28
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:48,190
I still can't believe we're gonna be at Canterlot tonight. Our home town, Twilight!

29
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:51,874
And best part is that we all get to hang out together all night long!

30
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,248
Uh... I-I don't know, Spike.

31
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:58,280
We'll just have to see.

32
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:02,359
We're gonna be a mite busy.

33
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:05,177
Busy having fun!

34
00:03:06,744 --> 00:03:09,022
Oh. Okay.

35
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:13,251
Don't worry, Spike. We'll all get to spend some time together.

36
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:14,252
Great!

37
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:24,491
Cause I planned out my insider's tour of Canterlot. I've gotta show Rarity the crown jewels. And Applejack the Princess's golden apple tree. And Pinkie, we gotta go to my favorite donut shop.

38
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:33,023
- Then let's get moving! Hyah!
- Excuse me?

39
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:38,296
- Um... I...
- If you weren't friends with our neighbor Rarity... Huh.

40
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:04,035
Wow!

41
00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:08,861
You all look... amazing!

42
00:04:09,377 --> 00:04:17,332
I can't believe we're finally here! With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is sure to make this the best night ever!

43
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,265
At the Gala (at the Gala)

44
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:21,242
At the Gala, in the garden

45
00:04:21,243 --> 00:04:23,513
I'm going to see them all

46
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:27,616
all the creatures, I'll befriend them at the Gala! (at the Gala)

47
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:29,631
All the birdies and the critters

48
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:31,903
They will love me big and small

49
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,042
We'll become good friends forever

50
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:42,322
Right here at the Gala!
(All our dreams will come true right here at the Gala, at the Gala!)

51
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,567
At the Gala (it's amazing), I will sell them (better hurry)

52
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:46,577
All my appletastic treats (yummy, yummy)

53
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,630
Hungry ponies (they'll be snacking), they will buy them (bringing money)

54
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:50,768
Caramel apples, apple sweets! (gimme some)

55
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:58,952
And I'll earn a lot of money for the Apple family!
(All our dreams and our hopes from now until hereafter)

56
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:05,043
(All that we've been wishing for will happen at the Gala, at the Gala!)

57
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:07,388
At the Gala, all the royals

58
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:09,400
They will meet fair Rarity

59
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:13,587
They will see I'm just as regal at the Gala! (at the Gala)

60
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:15,682
I will find him, my Prince Charming,

61
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,799
and how gallant he will be,

62
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:26,262
he will treat me like a lady, tonight at the Gala!
(This is what we've waited for, to have the best night ever)

63
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:32,345
(Each of us will live our dreams, tonight at the Gala, at the Gala!)

64
00:05:37,863 --> 00:05:40,120
I've been dreaming, I've been waiting

65
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:42,313
To fly with those brave ponies

66
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:44,506
The Wonderbolts, their daring tricks

67
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:46,656
Spinning 'round and having kicks

68
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:48,620
Perform for crowds of thousands

69
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:50,632
They'll shower us with diamonds

70
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:58,701
The Wonderbolts will see me right here at the Gala!
(All we've come for, all we've dreamed, our happy ever after)

71
00:05:58,702 --> 00:06:04,834
(Finally they'll all come true, right here at the Grand Gala, at the Gala!)

72
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:08,571
I am here at the Grand Gala, for it is the best party

73
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:12,830
But the one thing it was missing was a pony named Pinkie

74
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:17,133
For I am the best at parties, all the ponies will agree

75
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:25,365
Ponies playing, ponies dancing, with me at the Grand Gala!
(Happiness and laughter at the Gala, at the Gala!)

76
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:32,082
At the gala (at the gala), with the princess (with the princess)

77
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,116
Is where I'm going to be (she will be)

78
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:38,415
We will talk all about magic and what I've learned and seen (she will see)

79
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:46,309
It is going to be so special as she takes time just for me!
(This will be the best night ever!)

80
00:06:46,996 --> 00:06:50,864
(Into the Gala we must go, we're ready now, we're all aglow)

81
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:55,082
(Into the Gala, let's go in and have the best night ever)

82
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:59,301
(Into the Gala, now's the time, we're ready and we look divine)

83
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:01,247
(Into the Gala) meet new friends

84
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:03,626
(Into the Gala) sell some apples

85
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:05,608
(Into the Gala) find my prince

86
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:07,435
(Prove I'm great) as a Wonderbolt is

87
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:07,836
To meet

88
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:08,337
To sell

89
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:08,838
To find

90
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,439
To prove

91
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,940
To whoop

92
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:10,641
To talk

93
00:07:11,142 --> 00:07:15,091
(Into the Gala, into the Gala!) x2

94
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:21,787
(And we'll have the best night ever!)

95
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:25,332
(At the Gala!)

96
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,721
Yeah! This is gonna be the best night ever. You know why?

97
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:31,191
Cause we're all gonna spend time at the Gala to--

98
00:07:33,347 --> 00:07:36,087
--gether. Or not.

99
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,483
Princess Celestia!

100
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,763
Twilight! It is so lovely to see my star student.

101
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:55,560
Oh, I'm so excited to be here! We have so much to catch up on.

102
00:07:55,561 --> 00:08:00,189
Well, I want you right by my side the entire evening, so we'll have plenty of time together.

103
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:03,630
That's just what I was hoping you'd say.

104
00:08:13,857 --> 00:08:17,750
Hurry, Rarity... Oh, but not too fast. But don't wanna lose him... WAIT!

105
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:23,956
Have to play it cool. Oh, but don't be cold! I can't lose him, I can't! He's everything I imagined!

106
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:29,147
Even better than I imagined.

107
00:08:35,235 --> 00:08:37,855
Oh my! A meadowlark!

108
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:46,376
I think she's calling to me. It's exactly what I wished for!

109
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:00,984
Howdy, partner! You hungry?

110
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:02,285
As a horse!

111
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,492
Well, what's you're hungering for? Caramel apple? Apple pie? Apple fritter? Apple fries?

112
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:09,860
I'll take that big apple pie!

113
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:17,068
Well, thank you kindly, sir! Yeehaw! In the first minute, I made my first sale. Just like I expected.

114
00:09:22,315 --> 00:09:24,916
Always hungry after a show. Eh, Soaren?

115
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:25,917
Heh. Yeah!

116
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:30,415
My pie!

117
00:09:33,136 --> 00:09:35,625
You saved it! Thanks...

118
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:37,326
Hey, no prob.

119
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:43,767
Hey! I know you. You're the pony that saved us in Cloudsdale in one The Best Flyer Competition.

120
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:46,438
Hay yeah! Name's Rainbow Dash.

121
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:52,634
Well, Rainbow Dash. Looks like your skills saved us again. Oh, at least they saved Soaren's apple pie.

122
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,549
- Wanna come hang out with us?
- Sure! Why not?

123
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:05,827
I'm... hanging... with the... Wonderbolts!

124
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:19,465
The shiny dance floor... The pretty party ponies... Ooh, the fancy band... Shiny! Pretty! Fancy!

125
00:10:21,494 --> 00:10:22,684
Gotta dance!

126
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,909
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala x2

127
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,411
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gaalaaa!

128
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:32,754
It's all I ever dreamed! x2
Youhou!

129
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:34,546
It's all I ever dreamed!
Yippee!

130
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:39,259
I'm at the Grand Galloping GalaaaAAAA!

131
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,879
It's all I've ever... dreamed?

132
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,213
Well, hello. I am Prince Blueblood.

133
00:10:54,214 --> 00:11:02,207
- I am... Rarity. Oh my, what a lovely rose.
- You mean... this rose?

134
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:07,600
Thank you. It goes with my eyes.

135
00:11:13,987 --> 00:11:17,060
My little meadowlark is right around this bend!

136
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:22,336
- Was that you?
- Yep!

137
00:11:22,337 --> 00:11:24,284
I love whistlin' while I work.

138
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:29,757
Oh! Yes... Well... Excuse me.

139
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:38,542
Oh! I see a toco toucan! And a spider monkey! And, oh! Is that a wallaroo?

140
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,556
Oh, Fluttershy. You're such a loudmouth.

141
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:58,329
Hey, Spitfire! You ever done a rain cloud double backflip?

142
00:12:00,758 --> 00:12:03,740
You ever swerved past lightning? It's awesome!

143
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,516
Welcome to the Grand Galloping Gala.

144
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:18,516
- Princess! I've been so excited to spend time with you and...
- Yes. Me too, Twi... Oh good evening!

145
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:19,823
Welcome to the Gala.

146
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:25,269
Which is why I... Ladies! Lovely to see you again.

147
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:32,737
Looks like getting a chance to talk to the Princess is gonna be a magic trick in itself.

148
00:12:34,595 --> 00:12:43,483
First minute, first sale. Second... Fourth... Sixth... Sixtieth minute... no sales.

149
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:46,858
This ain't what I expected at all.

150
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:55,044
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala... and it's not what I dreamed.

151
00:12:58,534 --> 00:13:01,751
This isn't at all what I imagined.

152
00:13:08,252 --> 00:13:10,429
This isn't what I hoped.

153
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:14,674
This isn't hanging out.

154
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:19,288
This isn't what I wished for.

155
00:13:19,921 --> 00:13:20,289
No!

156
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:22,382
I waited all my life...

157
00:13:22,383 --> 00:13:23,483
... for this moment.

158
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:24,841
And I'm not going to...

159
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:25,842
... let it slip by.

160
00:13:25,843 --> 00:13:27,921
If it's the last thing I do...

161
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:29,458
... I'm gonna make this...

162
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:32,469
... the best night ever!

163
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:38,369
I just have to be more bold, like Twilight says.

164
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:47,903
I'm so sorry to have scared you, my friends! But I'm leaving now, so you can all come out!

165
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:56,041
Gotcha! It's okay. I promise not to hurt you. I just wanna be your...

166
00:13:57,487 --> 00:14:00,721
friend?
- Mmm, sounds good to me.

167
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:09,132
Come on, Rainbow! If they don't notice you, you gotta make 'em notice you.

168
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:39,264
- Just give him a chance, Rarity. His princely side is sure to come out if you're just patient.
- Miss Rarity! Stop!

169
00:14:40,036 --> 00:14:43,938
Oh. Prince Blueblood! How chivalrous.

170
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:45,039
One would hate to slip.

171
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,837
Yes. "One" certainly would.

172
00:14:47,838 --> 00:14:50,228
One's cloak should take care of the problem.

173
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:52,032
Oh, of course it will.

174
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:17,885
C'mon everypony! I know what will make you shake those groove-thangs!

175
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,475
You reach your right hoof in

176
00:15:21,476 --> 00:15:23,267
You reach your right hoof out

177
00:15:23,268 --> 00:15:24,918
You reach your right hoof in

178
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,809
And you shake it all about

179
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,680
You do the Pony Pokey meeting lots of folks with clout

180
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:33,357
That's what I'm talking about

181
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:36,044
You step your left hoof in

182
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:37,885
You pull it right back out

183
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:39,377
You step your left hoof in

184
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:41,444
But you better help him out

185
00:15:41,445 --> 00:15:45,378
You do the Pony Pokey but you'd find a different route

186
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,905
That's what it's all about

187
00:15:48,006 --> 00:15:50,370
You kick your back leg in

188
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:52,256
You pull your back leg out

189
00:15:52,257 --> 00:15:53,914
You reach your back leg in

190
00:15:53,915 --> 00:15:55,934
Just be brave and have no doubt

191
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:59,726
You do the Pony Pokey feeling like you're gonna pout

192
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:02,442
That's what I'm singing about

193
00:16:02,443 --> 00:16:04,993
You tilt your head in

194
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:06,899
You tilt your head out

195
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,601
You tilt your head it all about

196
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:14,224
You do the Pony Pokey even though your date's a lout

197
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:17,078
You're better off without

198
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:19,519
You stomp your whole self in

199
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,392
You stomp your whole self out

200
00:16:21,393 --> 00:16:23,042
You stomp your whole self in

201
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:24,943
And you stomp yourself about

202
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:28,299
You do the Pony Pokey and you give a little shout

203
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,000
COME OUT!

204
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:31,391
That's what I'm talking about.

205
00:16:32,378 --> 00:16:37,620
You do the Pony Pokey x3

206
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:41,932
And that's what it's all about... Yeah!

207
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:45,775
Young lady, this is not 'that' kind of party.

208
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:54,318
Ooooooh... They don't want a party. These ponies want a paaarteeey!

209
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:57,611
Two apple fritters, please.

210
00:16:57,612 --> 00:17:01,080
Two apple fritters comin' right up. That'll be four bits.

211
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:03,172
- Ahem.
- Ahem.

212
00:17:03,173 --> 00:17:06,030
- Ahem.
- AHEM.

213
00:17:06,913 --> 00:17:09,311
I'm going to have to pay, aren't I?

214
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:12,039
It's okay, Rariry. I got you covered.

215
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:17,238
Thank you, Applejack. At least somepony here has good manners.

216
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:28,251
Oh! Fritters! Dumplings! Caramel apples! My royal lips have touched common carnival fare!

217
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:31,663
I'm going to the buffet for some... hors d'oeuvres.

218
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:37,981
Well, no wonder nopony wants my food. They're fillin' up on those fancy-schmancy vittles.

219
00:17:37,982 --> 00:17:43,665
Well, my down-home apples are plenty good enough for this crowd. I'll just dress 'em up a bit and prove it to 'em.

220
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:56,161
I'll catch you yet, my pretties. Oh yes. As soon as one of you little birds or monkeys or bears touches this net... you'll be MINE! MINE!!

221
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:11,532
Come on, everypony! You wanted a partey? Now it's paaarteeey! 

222
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:16,380
Yeah! Uh! Now that's a beat, yeah! Uh! C'mon, dance! 

223
00:18:17,892 --> 00:18:19,613
Yeah, woohoo!

224
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:28,266
Okay, all you high-class ponies. Here's a highfalutin apple cake for your hoity-toity taste buds.

225
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:30,722
STAGE DIVE!

226
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:47,280
You, sir, are the most uncharming prince I have ever met! Seems like the only thing royal about you is that you are a royal pain!

227
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:50,788
Ewww...! Uh, stay back! I just had myself groomed!

228
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:53,398
Afraid to get dirty?! 

229
00:19:00,225 --> 00:19:02,099
This is my chance! 

230
00:19:05,072 --> 00:19:07,862
Yes! Whoa!

231
00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:29,089
Well... it can't get any worse.

232
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:37,058
You're... going to LOVE ME!!!

233
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:45,157
Run. 

234
00:19:55,588 --> 00:19:59,810
Ooh! Rarity, your glass slipper! Now your prince is sure to find you. 

235
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:03,413
No! Ugh! Let's go! 

236
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:08,826
Hey, Pony Joe. Another donut.

237
00:20:09,027 --> 00:20:10,542
Don't you think you've had enough?

238
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,248
Another donut! Extra sprinkles!

239
00:20:14,354 --> 00:20:18,566
Twilight Sparkle! Ha, ha. Long time no see.

240
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,596
Hey, how was the Gala? How was your best night ever? 

241
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:26,927
- That sound like the worst night ever!
- It was!

242
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:33,786
I just hope Princess Celestia isn't upset at us for ruining the Gala.

243
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:37,260
That was the best Grand Galloping Gala ever!

244
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:39,275
Princess Celestia?!

245
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:43,926
Pardon me, Princess, but tonight was just awful.

246
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:48,906
- Oh, Twilight. The Grand Galloping Gala is always awful.
- It is?

247
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:53,872
That is why I was thrilled you were all attending. I was hoping you could liven things up a bit. 

248
00:20:53,873 --> 00:21:00,770
And while the evening may not have gone as you planned, I'm sure you'll agree that in the end it didn't turn out so bad for this group of friends.

249
00:21:01,071 --> 00:21:06,638
You're right, Princess. Friends have a way of making even the worst of times into something pretty great.

250
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:09,710
- Yeah! Hanging out with friends!
- Talking!

251
00:21:09,911 --> 00:21:10,811
Laughing!

252
00:21:11,012 --> 00:21:16,940
- You mean doing exactly what I wanted to do the whole time?
- Yeah, Spike. You were right.

253
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:19,083
As horrible as our night was...

254
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:21,747
...being together here has made it all better.

255
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:23,752
In fact, it's made it...

256
00:21:23,753 --> 00:21:26,391
...the best night ever!
