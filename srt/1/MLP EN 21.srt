1
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:20,580
And that's when the yellow birdie thought to himself, "Hmm. My favorite little tree isn't such a little tree anymore."

2
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:30,160
So she sang her song, big and strong, and they all lived in that great, big tree happily ever after. The... End.

3
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,070
Applejack! Were you reading a bedtime story to... An apple tree?

4
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,800
Well, ya know, being replanted in a whole new place is very upsettin' for a tree...

5
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,270
And Bloomberg here is one of my favorites.

6
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,040
No fair, Applejack! You've got a luxurious, private sleeper car for a tree,

7
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,810
while I am crowded and cramped in the same car with all the other ponies.

8
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,520
How am I supposed to get my beauty sleep?!

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,510
But Bloomberg's the whole reason we're makin' this trip.

10
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,530
He needs his rest so we can give him as a gift to my relatives in Appleloosa.

11
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,820
You talk about it as if it's your baby or something.

12
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,340
Who you calling a baby?! Bloomberg's no baby!

13
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:19,850
Don't wet widdle Rarity make you all saddy-waddy. Bloomberg's a big and strong apple tree. Yes, he is.

14
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,930
It's widdle Rarity who's all saddy-waddy!

15
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,590
Oh man, we're going fast! This is so exciting I can't even wait!

16
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,900
For crying out loud in the morning!

17
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:30,060
Do you guys mind? I was up early fire-roasting those snacks you're all eating, and I'm pooped!

18
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,970
Speaking of, some of these popcorn kernels didn't get popped.

19
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,920
Okay, fine...

20
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,110
Good Night!

21
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,820
Maybe it's time we all got a little shut-eye. We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.

22
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,440
Pinkie Pie, you asleep yet?

23
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,790
No, are you asleep yet?

24
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,240
If I was sleeping, how could I have asked you if you were asleep?

25
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,150
Oh yeah!

26
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,210
When we get to Appleloosa, you think we'll have to carry that heavy tree all the way from the train to the orchard?

27
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,120
What tree? You mean Bloomberg?

28
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,020
No... Fluttershy.

29
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,310
Fluttershy's not a tree, silly!

30
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,560
What's going on?

31
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,910
Rainbow Dash thinks Fluttershy's a tree!

32
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,560
I do not think she's a tree! I was just...

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,160
Did you say she was a tree?

34
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,410
No. Well.. Yes. But not exactly...

35
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,460
Ya know she's not a tree, right?

36
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,630
She's not a tree, Dashy!

37
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,160
I'd like to be a tree!

38
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,220
For pete's sake!

39
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,090
Well that was kind of huffy.

40
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,090
Huffy the magic dragon!

41
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,790
Would you all be QUIET... NOOOOW!!!

42
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,830
Bloomberg?

43
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,120
Bloomberg!

44
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,080
Sorry, but I tend to snore a bit. Good night.

45
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,900
A buffalo stampede!

46
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,060
I just love their accessories!

47
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,280
They're getting awfully close to the train.

48
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,180
Oh, looky! Now they're doing TRICKS!

49
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,440
Now do a back-flip!

50
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,560
Or... Just jump?

51
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,160
Something tells me this isn't a circus act.

52
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,080
Hey there! Where ya headed in such a hurry?

53
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,940
Wow, you're pretty quick for someone so... Bulky... No offense.

54
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,860
I just wanna know...

55
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,580
I'm talking to you...

56
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,000
I got you now, you ...

57
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,370
They've got Bloomberg!

58
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,480
Heeeelp!

59
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
And Spike!

60
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,970
Heeelp!

61
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,100
Dragon-napping Spike. I'll show her!

62
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,520
Hey there! Welcome ta Applelooosa!

63
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,570
Braeburn, listen...

64
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:48,390
Cousin Apple Jack, mind yer manners, you have yet ta introduce me to your compadres! Shame on you!

65
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,560
Braeburn, listen, something terrible has happened....

66
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,830
Terrible is right, your train is full seven minutes late!

67
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:59,840
That's seven minutes less for you to delight in the pleasures and wonders of... Applelooosa!

68
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,100
Boggles the mind, we settler ponies built all this in just the past year, don't it?!

69
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,420
And as you can see, we have all of the finest comforts. Like horse-drawn carriages!

70
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,020
- Okay, you pull now.
- Aww, we just switched.

71
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,270
And those there are horse-drawn, horse-drawn carriages.

72
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,470
Listen, Braeburn, I...

73
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,990
And here's are local waterin' hole, the Salt Block.

74
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,360
That's enough salt for you!!

75
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,090
Can't I at least... Get a glass of water?

76
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,870
Over there's the office of Sheriff Silverstar.

77
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,030
And here's where we have out wild west dances!

78
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,700
And here's where we have out mild west dances!

79
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,250
But, Braeburn, we...

80
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:53,020
And here's the most wonderful sight in all of... Applelooosa! Our apple orchard.

81
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,670
- Braeburn!
- First harvest should be any day now.

82
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,970
- Braeburn!
- Good thing too!

83
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,700
- Brae...
- 'cause we need that grub to live on.

84
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,390
Braeburn!

85
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,260
Yes, cuz?

86
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:08,440
You have a very nice town an' all, but but we have a HUGE problem! Some of our friends are missing!

87
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,030
- A stampede of buffalo.
- They took Spike!

88
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,860
- Rainbow Dash went after them!
- And we can't find Pinkie Pie.

89
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,980
And we had an apple tree with us for your orchard, but they took that too!

90
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,270
Did you say... Buffalo?

91
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,160
Them buffalo, they want us settler ponies to take every single tree you see here off this land.

92
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,610
They sure as hay don't want any new ones added in.

93
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,640
But why?

94
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,680
Beats me. We put a lot of hard work into this land, so we can feed our town, our families, our foals!

95
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,640
And now they're saying all these trees have to go? It ain't fair...

96
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,100
I can't wait to get my hooves on that little buffalo...

97
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,040
- Nobody tricks Rainbow Dash and gets away with it.
- Boo!!

98
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,810
Pinkie Pie!

99
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,210
You caught me! Looks like I tricked you and didn't get away with it either! You're goood.

100
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,860
What do you think you're doing?! You gotta get out of here!

101
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,010
I do?

102
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,680
You're gonna blow my cover.

103
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,900
I am?

104
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,770
I'm trying to save Spike!

105
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,300
Oh my gosh, so am I!

106
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,830
And the more of us there are out here, the more chances of us getting...

107
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,140
... caught.

108
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,480
Run, Pinkie, I'll hold 'em off. Save yourself!

109
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,390
Stop!

110
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,400
Dash, Pinkie... 'Sup? Hey, no worries I know those guys.

111
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,950
- They're cool.
- If you say so, Spike. Catch ya later, bro.

112
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,370
Seems they took me by mistake.. And they feel awful about it, too, poor guys.

113
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:00,110
Fortunately, they totally respect dragons, so they treat me like an honored guest.

114
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,640
Still don't like ponies much, though... But you're with me, so it's cool.

115
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,560
Well, I still don't trust them. I say we turn tail and bail while we still...

116
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,400
Before we finish eating? Are you loco in the coco?!

117
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,240
Can I please have more of that mushy stuff, whatever it was?

118
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,220
Certainly.

119
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,900
And, Mr. Spike, you like gemstones, yes?

120
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,980
Turquoise.

121
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:29,490
This here is Little Strongheart, and these are my friends Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash.

122
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,620
- You!
- You!

123
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,770
That's it! We are outta here!

124
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:43,730
Wait! Please accept my apologies for what happened on the train, we didn't mean for anyone to be hurt.

125
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,750
Yeah, right.

126
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,180
We only wanted the tree. The settler ponies have overtaken the land and have planted an orchard all over it!

127
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:57,620
Because of their thoughtlessness, we can no longer run over our traditional stampeding grounds...

128
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,480
I think it's time they met Chief Thunderhooves.

129
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:10,580
We have a long and winding stampeding trail, that we have run upon for many generations.

130
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:23,370
My father stampeded upon these grounds, and his father before him, and his father before him, and his father before him.

131
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,970
And his father before him. And...

132
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,540
I think they get the idea, Chief.

133
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,740
It is a sacred tradition to run the path every year.

134
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:43,390
But this year, these... Settler ponies, these... Appleloosians!

135
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,860
They planted apple trees all over it without asking our permission.

136
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,990
Well that's not very nice. Right, Rainbow Dash?

137
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,640
The ponies refused to move their trees, so we are stuck here, and it is not fair!

138
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,970
See Rainbow Dash? They had a good reason to...

139
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,660
I'll say they had a good reason!

140
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,080
C'mon. We have some apple-pickin' Appleloosians to talk to!

141
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,730
Gently, please!

142
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,170
Sorry, Rarity, but our friends are out there and we have ta be ready for a long hike

143
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,540
into buffalo territory if we're gonna save 'em.

144
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,540
Let's go!

145
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,630
- Hi guys!
- Pinkie!

146
00:12:35,784 --> 00:12:37,940
We're so glad you're safe.

147
00:12:37,941 --> 00:12:40,566
- Oh, there you are!
- Thank goodness!

148
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:42,580
How did you escape from the buffalo?

149
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,580
We didn't!

150
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,060
We promised the buffalo a chance to talk.

151
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,060
Oh, yeah? 'Bout what?

152
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,560
We brought our new pal, Little Strongheart here, to explain to the Appleloosians

153
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,400
why they should move the apple trees off buffalo land.

154
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,820
That information would be quite help...

155
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:03,810
That's weird. 'cause my cousin, Braeburn, here, wants to explain to the buffalo why they should let the apple trees stay.

156
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,270
That would be a useful thing to...

157
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:12,000
The land is theirs! You planted the trees not knowing that. Honest mistake. Now, you just gotta move 'em, that's all.

158
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,310
Well...

159
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:19,890
They busted their rumps here! An' now they're suppos't ta bust their rumps again, just 'cause some buffalo won't stampede someplace else?

160
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,600
Plant the trees somewhere else!

161
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,980
Where?! It's the only flatland around these parts!

162
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,920
The buffalo had it first!

163
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,450
The settler ponies need it to LIVE!

164
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,100
- Come on Applejack!
- You're bein' unreasonable!

165
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,130
Look. Both the settlers and the buffalo have good reasons to use this land.

166
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,230
There must be something we can do.

167
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,010
Hey! I've got an idea!

168
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,280
We may be divided

169
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:03,533
But of you all, I beg

170
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:05,982
To remember we're all hoofed

171
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:09,972
At the end of each leg

172
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,878
No matter what the issue

173
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,433
Come from wherever you please

174
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:17,208
All this fighting gets you nothing

175
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:19,156
But hoof-in-mouth disease

176
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,691
Arguing's not the way

177
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:22,453
Hey, come out and play

178
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:24,113
It's a shiny, new day

179
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,825
So what do you say?

180
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,380
You gotta share, you gotta care

181
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:31,083
It's the right thing to do

182
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:34,712
You gotta share, you gotta care

183
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:37,892
And there'll always be a way through

184
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,914
Both our diets, I should mention

185
00:14:39,915 --> 00:14:41,674
Are completely vegetarian

186
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:43,135
We all eat hay and oats

187
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:44,839
Why be at each other's throat?

188
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:48,445
You gotta share, you gotta care

189
00:14:48,446 --> 00:14:50,045
It's the right thing to do

190
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:56,946
And there'll always be a way throuuuuuuugh

191
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:05,850
All right, Pinkie Pie! That was fantastic! What a great song! You're right on!!

192
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:13,850
It appears that Sheriff Silverstar and I have come to... An agreement.

193
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,850
We have.

194
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,330
That was the worst performance we've ever seen...

195
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,780
Absolutely.

196
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:28,870
The time for action... is upon us! Our stampede will start at high noon tomorrow.

197
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:36,460
And if the orchard is still there, we'll flatten IT! AND the whole town!

198
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,670
But, Chief!

199
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:44,690
An' we Appleloosians say you'd better bring yer best, 'cause we'll be ready and waitin'.

200
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,690
But, Sheriff...

201
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,580
Oh... That wasn't the message of my song at all...

202
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,080
I want my kin ta have what they need to live... But a storm's a-brewin' here.

203
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,910
And I don't like the look of it.

204
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,900
We've just got to talk some sense into them before somepony gets hurt.

205
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,940
Listen, maybe if you would just reconsider, we...

206
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,280
About the trees. Now if you could...

207
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,560
If we could just sit down and talk we could...

208
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,450
Why won't anybody be rational and reasonable?!

209
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,800
Sheriff, if we could only...

210
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,670
Isn't there someway to stop this?

211
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,150
Unless the settlers remove those trees, I do not think so.

212
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,620
I know you don't want to do this.

213
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:46,720
But they have taken out land. What would you have me do, Rainbow Dash?

214
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,140
I don't know... But it's never too late to think of something.

215
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,290
At noon, it will be too late.

216
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:16,060
Come on, THINK. Think, think, think, think, think, think, think!

217
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,510
He's not gonna do it!

218
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,626
You got to share, you got to care

219
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:51,332
It's the right thing to do

220
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,670
You got to share, you got to care

221
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:56,050
Charge!

222
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,280
Ready? 

223
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,270
Aim...

224
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,340
Fire!

225
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,430
I've got a much better idea! 

226
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:57,950
We... Will allow the apple orchard to stay in exchange for a share of it's fruit. Those... Delicious apple pies!

227
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,600
I'd rather eat turquoise any day of the week. 

228
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:10,470
Bloomberg, this is yer special day. Mama's so proud of you!

229
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:22,140
Dear, Princess Celestia. Friendship is a wonderous and powerful thing. 

230
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,380
Even the worst of enemies can become friends. You need understanding and compromise. 

231
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,290
You've got to share. You've got to care

232
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,520
Hé! That's what I said!
