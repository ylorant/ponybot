1
00:00:02,114 --> 00:00:04,974
Oh, Opalescence. Can you just picture it?

2
00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:10,920
Moi, stepping up in astounding new gown at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!

3
00:00:14,844 --> 00:00:19,680
Why, yes! I did make it myself. Thank you so much for asking.

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,647
Oh, oh. Look who wants to help me. Thank you.

5
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:38,734
What's that? You wanna help me more! Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?

6
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:46,029
Careful now. Don't move. This shouldn't take long at all. 

7
00:01:31,677 --> 00:01:33,178
Howdy, Rarity?

8
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:37,261
Shh... Can't you see Rarity is trying to concentrate?

9
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,023
What do you think she's makin'?

10
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,163
Looks like a dress.

11
00:01:42,364 --> 00:01:46,287
Well, that makes sense. Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all.

12
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,080
Is there something I can help you with?

13
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:53,569
Oh, so very sorry to trouble you, Rarity, but I need a quick favor. 

14
00:01:55,393 --> 00:01:59,705
Could you please fix the button for me? It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala.

15
00:01:59,706 --> 00:02:05,890
Oh, no, no, no! You can't wear this... old thing. 

16
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:11,949
You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala and I'll make it for you. No problem at all. It will be my pleasure!

17
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:18,043
Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, Rarity, but I can't let you do that. It would be so much work. 

18
00:02:18,044 --> 00:02:19,644
This dress is fine.

19
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:23,577
Twilight Sparkle. I insist on making you a new dress.

20
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,078
- But--
- Not another word!

21
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,353
I won't take 'no' for an answer.

22
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:31,816
Well, in that case... Thank you for your generosity, Rarity. 

23
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:35,654
Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful.

24
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,398
Let me guess, Applejack. You don't want a new gown either.

25
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:44,824
Gown? Shoot. I was just gonna wear my old work duds.

26
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:51,271
You can't possibly be serious, Applejack! You absolutely must wear formal attire.

27
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:54,032
Nah.

28
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:59,414
What if I just spruce up your... duds for you a little bit?

29
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:06,263
Okay, sure. Why not? Since you're up for it and all. Just don't make them too... froufrou-y.

30
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:08,827
- Deal!
- Look out below!

31
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,163
Sorry. New trick. Didn't quite work.

32
00:03:19,188 --> 00:03:25,065
Idea! I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash.

33
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,742
Outfit for the what now?

34
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:32,106
I'll make one for you and you and all of you. Oh!

35
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:37,798
And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too. Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!

36
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,239
What a great idea! If you're sure you can handle it.

37
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,366
Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business. 

38
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:46,767
Plus, fun!

39
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,110
Oh, I love fun things!

40
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:53,556
Then it's settled. We'll have a fashion show starring us.

41
00:03:56,965 --> 00:04:06,538
So all you have to do is make a different, stunning, original, amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five... plus yourself, six ponies?

42
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,039
And lickety split?

43
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,874
Oh, Applejack. You make it sound as if it's going to be hard.

44
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:21,892
Thread by thread, stitching it together 

45
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:25,991
Twilight's dress, cutting out the pattern snip by snip 

46
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:28,251
Making sure the fabric folds nicely 

47
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:30,056
It's the perfect color and so hip 

48
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:32,212
Always gotta keep in mind my pacing 

49
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:34,341
Making sure the clothes correctly facing 

50
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:39,728
I'm stitching Twilight's dress 

51
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:44,780
Yard by yard, fussing on the details 

52
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:48,779
Jewel neckline, don't you know a stitch in time saves nine? 

53
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,851
Make her something perfect to inspire 

54
00:04:50,852 --> 00:04:52,897
Even though she hates formal attire 

55
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:54,988
Gotta mind those intimate details 

56
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:57,168
Even though she's more concerned with sales 

57
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:02,371
It's Applejack's new dress 

58
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:07,770
Dressmaking's easy, for Pinkie Pie something pink 

59
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:09,571
Fluttershy something breezy 

60
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:10,648
Blend color and form... 

61
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:11,949
Do you think it looks cheesy? 

62
00:05:16,094 --> 00:05:19,732
Something brash, perhaps quite fetching 

63
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:23,930
Hook and eye, couldn't you just simply die? 

64
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:25,976
Making sure it fits forelock and crest 

65
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,969
Don't forget some magic in the dress 

66
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,177
Even though it rides high on the flank 

67
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:32,255
Rainbow won't look like a tank 

68
00:05:32,256 --> 00:05:38,385
I'm stitching Rainbow's dress 

69
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:41,123
Piece by piece, snip by snip 

70
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:43,196
Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip 

71
00:05:43,197 --> 00:05:45,345
Thread by thread, primmed and pressed 

72
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,485
Yard by yard, never stressed 

73
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:54,663
And that's the Art of the Dress!

74
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,998
That's it. Keep them closed. 

75
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:02,399
Don't look.

76
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:05,306
Okay, you can look now!

77
00:06:06,512 --> 00:06:09,151
These are your new outfits.

78
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:14,992
What do you think of your old duds now, Applejack? Pretty swanky, are they not?

79
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:22,774
And Twilight! I made this dress for you and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality.

80
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:26,895
Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it. 

81
00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:29,749
Oh, and it turned out BEAUTIFUL, don't you think? 

82
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,309
Ooh, and I know you are going to love yours, Fluttershy. It just sings spring!

83
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:41,185
And Pinkie Pie, look! Pink! Your favorite! Aren't they all amazing?

84
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:50,245
Wow... They're...

85
00:06:50,246 --> 00:06:51,746
Yeah, they're...

86
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:56,068
- They sure are... sumth'n.
- Yes! Something.

87
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:59,084
I love something! Something is my favorite.

88
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,008
It's... nice.

89
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:03,203
But what's the matter? Don't you like them?

90
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:04,704
They're very nice...

91
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:08,329
And we're plum grateful cause you worked so hard on them.

92
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,959
Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining.

93
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,353
She asked.

94
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:18,447
I guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind.

95
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:26,111
That's okay. Not a problem. There's plenty more where that came from.

96
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:32,141
They were only a first pass. You're my friends and I want you to be 110% satisfied. 

97
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:34,792
Not to worry, I'll redo them.

98
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:38,459
Oh, Rarity. You don't have to do that. They're fine.

99
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,723
I want them to be better that just fine. I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.

100
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:46,832
Are you sure? I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose.

101
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,877
Oh, it's no imposition. Really, I insist.

102
00:07:51,813 --> 00:07:55,066
Well, in that case... Thank you again, Rarity.

103
00:07:59,943 --> 00:08:02,963
What have I gotten myself into? 

104
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:11,458
Hello? You wanted to see me, Rarity?

105
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:17,402
Fluttershy! Your new-new gown's ready. I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it. 

106
00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:19,342
What do you think?

107
00:08:20,671 --> 00:08:23,856
I... love it.

108
00:08:23,857 --> 00:08:25,878
Oh, you're just saying that.

109
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,383
No, no. I do. It's... nice.

110
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,384
"Nice"?

111
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,385
Nice.

112
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,674
If you don't like it, you should just tell me.

113
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:36,187
Oh, but I do like it.

114
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:37,969
Like it or love it?

115
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,596
Um... both?

116
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:40,597
Which is it?

117
00:08:40,598 --> 00:08:42,410
Please stop asking me this, I...

118
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:44,376
Well, just tell me what you really think.

119
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:45,477
No, that's okay...

120
00:08:45,478 --> 00:08:46,178
Tell me.

121
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,962
No... it's fine...

122
00:08:47,963 --> 00:08:48,963
Tell me.

123
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:50,568
I... like it...

124
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:52,782
Tell me, tell me, tellmetellmetellme!

125
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,967
All right! Since you really wanna know...

126
00:08:55,968 --> 00:09:11,413
The armscye's tight, the middy collar doesn't go with the shawl lapel, the hems are clearly machine-stitched, the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile, you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch and the overdesign is reminiscent of prêt-à-porter and not true French haute couture. 

127
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,811
But, uh... you know... um, whatever you wanna do is fine.

128
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:25,416
Now, the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate. Orion has three stars on his belt, not four. 

129
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,148
Stitch by stitch, stitching it together 

130
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:34,015
Deadline looms, don't you know the client's always right? 

131
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:36,183
Even if my fabric choice was perfect 

132
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:37,935
Got to get them all done by tonight 

133
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:40,291
Pinkie Pie, the color's too obtrusive 

134
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:42,067
Wait until you see it in the light 

135
00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:46,548
I'm sewing them together! 

136
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:49,537
Don't you think my gown would be more "me" with some lollipops?

137
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:50,538
Well, I think...

138
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:51,139
Balloons?

139
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,740
Well...

140
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:52,841
DO IT! 

141
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,345
Hour by hour, one more change 

142
00:09:56,346 --> 00:10:00,733
I'm sewing them together, take great pains 

143
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,317
Fluttershy, you're putting me in a bind 

144
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:05,190
Rainbow Dash, what is on your mind? 

145
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:07,263
Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time

146
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:12,738
Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine 

147
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,967
Dressmaking's easy, every customer's call 

148
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:18,934
Brings a whole new revision 

149
00:10:18,935 --> 00:10:21,749
Have to pick up the pace, still hold to my vision 

150
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:26,636
That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor.

151
00:10:26,737 --> 00:10:29,623
French haute couture, please.

152
00:10:32,738 --> 00:10:35,872
What if it rains? Galoshes!

153
00:10:36,273 --> 00:10:43,232
More balloons! Oh no, that's too many balloons. More candy! Oh, less candy. Oh wait, I know. Streamers!

154
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:44,233
Streamers?

155
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:46,169
Whose dress is this?

156
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,152
Streamers it is. 

157
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:54,717
- What?
- Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?

158
00:10:54,718 --> 00:10:57,240
No, I just want my dress to be cool.

159
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,681
Do you not like the color?

160
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:01,681
The color's fine, just make it look cooler.

161
00:11:01,682 --> 00:11:02,682
Do you not like the shape?

162
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:06,243
The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler.

163
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:09,243
It needs to be about 20% cooler.

164
00:11:10,362 --> 00:11:12,428
All we ever want is indecision 

165
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:14,369
All we really like is what we know 

166
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,593
Gotta balance style with adherence 

167
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:18,741
Making sure we make a good appearance 

168
00:11:18,742 --> 00:11:20,707
Even if you simply have to fudge it 

169
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,687
Make sure that it stays within our budget 

170
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:28,943
Got to overcome intimidation. Remember, it's all in the presentation! 

171
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:31,372
Piece by piece, snip by snip 

172
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:33,404
Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip 

173
00:11:33,405 --> 00:11:35,542
Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed 

174
00:11:35,543 --> 00:11:37,633
Yard by yard, always stressed 

175
00:11:37,634 --> 00:11:43,587
And that's the Art of the Dress!

176
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:52,246
Oh, Opal. These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made. 

177
00:11:56,023 --> 00:12:02,993
Okay. I did exactly what each of you asked for. Now don't hold back. Let me know what you really think.

178
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:05,632
- Oh my!
- It's perfect!

179
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:09,557
- It's cool!
- Wow. They're the best duds I ever did see.

180
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:12,561
It's exactly what I asked for!

181
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:15,124
Thank you , Rarity.

182
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,368
Are you as happy with the as we're? Huh? Huh? Huh?

183
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:24,862
Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy. I'm just relieved to finally be done.

184
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,587
You are never gonna believe this! You've heard of Hoity-Toity?

185
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:33,002
The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?

186
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,516
Uh-huh. He heard about your fashion show. 

187
00:12:35,517 --> 00:12:41,413
Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him... He's coming here all the way from Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!

188
00:12:41,414 --> 00:12:47,272
Whoa, Nelly! You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy. You business will be boomin'!

189
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:56,126
Hoity-Toity? He's coming here? To see THESE dresses?

190
00:12:56,127 --> 00:13:00,010
Yep! Get ready for all of your dreams to come true. 

191
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,190
There he is! 

192
00:13:26,162 --> 00:13:30,653
Okay. Relax, Rarity. Your friends like their outfits and so will he. 

193
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,674
What's wrong with the lights?! Oh!

194
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:37,129
Yes. That means the show's starting. Good.

195
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:56,682
Since the beginning of time the elite of Equestria have longed for pony fashions that that truly expressed the essence of their very souls. 

196
00:13:56,683 --> 00:14:02,243
Patiently waiting decades... no, centuries! ...for the perfect pony gown. 

197
00:14:02,244 --> 00:14:06,341
Today at long last, Equestria, your wait is over! 

198
00:14:06,642 --> 00:14:12,763
Let's hear it for the breathtaking designs of Ponyville's own Rarity! 

199
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:37,099
Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?

200
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:41,388
Oh dear.

201
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:44,927
- You think we overdid it?
- Nah.

202
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,807
Okay, maybe a little.

203
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:55,311
Oh, those amateurish designs look like a piled-on mishmash of everything but a kitchen sink!

204
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:05,446
It's a travesty, it's what it is. Those outfits are the ugliest things I've ever seen, oh for shame.

205
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:11,771
Who is responsible for subjecting our eyes to these horrors? Not to mention wasting my valuable time.

206
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:13,702
Oh! Hide me.

207
00:15:14,828 --> 00:15:21,007
Come on out and take a bow, Rarity. You worked really hard for this. Yes! Alright, woohoo! Go, Rarity! 

208
00:15:33,403 --> 00:15:37,173
Rarity? You okay in there? You haven't come out for days.

209
00:15:37,174 --> 00:15:38,274
I'm never coming out! 

210
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:42,070
I can't show my face in Ponyville ever again! 

211
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:48,746
I used to be somepony. I used to be respected. I made dresses. Beautiful, beautiful dresses!

212
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:54,367
But now everypony is laughing at me. I'm nothing but a laughingstock!

213
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:59,292
- You're not a laughingstock, Rarity...
- She kind of is.

214
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,842
Shhh! Come on out and talk to us.

215
00:16:01,843 --> 00:16:09,918
Leave me alone! I vant to be alone! I want to wallow in...

216
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,149
whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in! 

217
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:21,373
Do ponies wallow in pity? Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in! I'M SO PATHETIC!

218
00:16:22,192 --> 00:16:23,877
Now what do we do?

219
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:25,431
Uh... Panic?

220
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:27,012
That's your answer for everything!

221
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:29,073
Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this.

222
00:16:29,074 --> 00:16:31,552
She'll become a crazy cat lady!

223
00:16:31,553 --> 00:16:32,968
She only has one cat.

224
00:16:32,969 --> 00:16:34,585
Give her time. 

225
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:46,553
Exile... I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile.

226
00:16:46,554 --> 00:16:51,605
Where would I go? And what would I pack? Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing.

227
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:55,885
What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile? Are you supposed to pack warm?

228
00:16:56,861 --> 00:16:58,129
Opal?

229
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:08,263
Opal, how did you get up there? Hang on, you poor dear! Mama's coming!

230
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:16,818
Rainbow Dash?! How dare you strand my poor Opal on the tree?!

231
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:20,882
Well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you this!

232
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:25,589
What is it? It's not... You...

233
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:29,303
We all finished your dress for you.

234
00:17:29,304 --> 00:17:32,294
Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing.

235
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:34,260
Do you like it?

236
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:39,212
Like it? 
Like it?!

237
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:41,626
Uh-uh. She doesn't like it.

238
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,041
No, I don't like it.

239
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:48,394
I LOVE IT!

240
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:54,684
You ponies did an amazing job. It's exactly the way I imagined it.

241
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:57,400
We just followed your brilliant design.

242
00:17:57,401 --> 00:18:03,260
Like you should have let you do for our outfits. Those first dressed you designed were perfect.

243
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:05,924
We're so super sorry.

244
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:12,957
You worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them. We all saw how well that turned out.

245
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,127
Oh, I forgive you.

246
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:17,376
Well, that's mighty big of you.

247
00:18:17,377 --> 00:18:20,465
But my whole career is still ruined!

248
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,326
Oh, right. That.

249
00:18:24,392 --> 00:18:25,995
Maybe not.

250
00:18:25,996 --> 00:18:28,592
All right, I haven't got all day. 

251
00:18:33,116 --> 00:18:34,766
Take two.

252
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:59,202
Hello... Oh, this can't be the same designer.

253
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:20,114
Simply magnificent! And suddenly I have a fresh craving for some Dutch apple pie. Candied apples on a stick? Apple turnovers? Apple cobbler?

254
00:19:37,131 --> 00:19:38,804
Brilliant!

255
00:19:53,232 --> 00:19:55,972
Oh, spectacular!

256
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:20,133
Now this is a fashion show. All of these dresses are absolutely amazing. Who is responsible? Step forward, show yourself!

257
00:20:26,056 --> 00:20:30,979
Bravo! Bravo! Magnifico! Oh boy!

258
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:36,498
Oh, thank you. Thank you! Oh, thank you so much!

259
00:20:37,373 --> 00:20:46,102
Dear Princess Celestia. This week my very talented friend Rarity learned that if you try to please everypony, you often times end up pleasing nopony

260
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:54,655
especially yourself. And I learned this: when somepony offers to do you a favor, like making you a beautiful dress,

261
00:20:54,656 --> 00:20:58,122
you shouldn't be overly critical of something generously given to you.

262
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,557
In other words, you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.

263
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:13,547
Rarity, my congratulations. You are the most impressive fashion maven.

264
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:21,825
Would you do me the great honor of allowing me to feature your couture in my best of the best boutique in Canterlot?

265
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:27,893
Now, I'll need you to make a dozen of each dress for me by next Tuesday.
