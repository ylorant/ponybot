1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,820
Not a bad pitch for a pony who works with her head in the clouds.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,650
Oh yeah? Think you can do better, cowgirl?

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,650
I know I can.

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,210
Oh, for Pete's sake!

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,940
Looks like this pegasus can pitch better than the workhorse.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,640
The object of the game is to get the closest to the stake.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,740
Alright, alright. You got another throw there, pony girl.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,580
Wow, Rainbow, heh. You couldn't hit a barn door with that kind of a throw.

9
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:42,230
Yeah, yeah. I still have the closest throw, Applesmack. Just try and beat it.

10
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,600
It's a ringer. That's how you do it down here on the farm.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,130
I lost.

12
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,290
Ah, don't feel bad, Rainbow. It's all in good fun.

13
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,410
I hate losing.

14
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,360
Besides, you're a mighty good athlete. I'm just better.

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,510
Alright, Applejack, you think you're the top athlete in all of Ponyville?

16
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,840
Well, I was gonna say in all of Equestria, but that might be gilding the lily.

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,790
And I think I'm the top athlete. So let's prove it.

18
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,840
Prove what?

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,920
I challenge you to an Iron Pony competition.

20
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,450
A series of athletic contests to decide who's the best, once and for all.

21
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,320
You know what, Rainbow? You're on.

22
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,150
So you two are doing what-now?

23
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,240
- An Iron...
- Iron Pony competition.

24
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,290
See, we've set up a bunch of events to decide which one of us is...

25
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,350
The most athletic pony ever!

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,410
And I'm here to...?

27
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,620
I don't know. Why is she here?

28
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,650
To be our judge and keep score.

29
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,170
Right. Somepony's gotta record my awesomeness for the history books.

30
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,240
Hello everypony, and welcome to the first annual Iron Pony competition!

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,150
Spike, who are you talking to?

32
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,430
Them!

33
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,150
Let the games begin!

34
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,850
Ready. Set. Go!

35
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,230
Dagnabit.

36
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,400
Time, Spike?

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,940
17 seconds.

38
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,400
You're kiddin'! That breaks my record from last year's rodeo.

39
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,030
But you got a five second penalty for nudging the barrel.

40
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,280
Nuts n' shrews.

41
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,650
Still, that's 22 seconds. Not too shabby. 

42
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:33,110
Don't be nervous. Remember, it's all in good fun. Now git on up there.

43
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,910
Ready. Set. Go!

44
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,990
Woo! That was some fancy hoofwork there, Rainbow!

45
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,160
Thanks, but I couldn't have been as fast as you.

46
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,860
What was the time on that, Spike?

47
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,590
18 seconds!

48
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,210
18 seconds. Rainbow, are you sure you're not secretly a rodeo pony?

49
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,000
Rainbow Dash wins the barrel lead!

50
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,490
Oh, I can't believe I won.

51
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,820
Yeah, well, don't you go gettin' used to it. 

52
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,830
Mighty respectable, but let me show ya how it's really done.

53
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,060
Years of applebuckin'.

54
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,610
Why me?

55
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,180
Go!

56
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,070
- Ready for another pony ride?
- No!

57
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,960
Go!

58
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,380
Rainbow Dash wins the bronco-buck.

59
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,410
And I lose. 

60
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,980
How do I get roped into these things?

61
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,790
Does this count? 

62
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:59,960
Fillies and gentlecolts, at the halfway point our competitors are tied at 5 and 5.

63
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,780
Who are you talking to?

64
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,780
Them!

65
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:16,530
95, 96, 97, 98, 99...

66
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,250
100!

67
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,780
Yes!

68
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,440
Be a good sport, Applejack. 

69
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:00,540
Alright, you two. This is the final event. Give it all you've got.

70
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,110
Looks like the workhorse might come out ahead in this one.

71
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,100
That's not fair. You can't use your wings to help you win.

72
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,180
You're cheatin'!

73
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,710
I can't understand you with that rope in your mouth.

74
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,710
I said...

75
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,040
I win by a landslide... 

76
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,450
or mudslide in your case. 

77
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,180
I am the Iron Pony!

78
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,860
Only 'cause you cheated.

79
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,440
What?

80
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,440
You used your wingpower to help you win over half those contests.

81
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,640
Sounds like sour apples to me.

82
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,440
Are you sayin' you didn't use your wings?

83
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,300
Well... no. But you never said I couldn't use my wings.

84
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,500
I didn't think I needed to tell you to play fair.

85
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,020
I still would have won even without my wings.

86
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,620
Prove it.

87
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,540
Gladly. How?

88
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,320
Tomorrow is the annual Runnin' of the Leaves. I challenge you to race me in it.

89
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,980
Easy shmeasy.

90
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,440
Hold on! 

91
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,530
There is one condition: the point is to run, so no wings allowed.

92
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,840
No wings? No problem.

93
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,510
Twilight, hurry up, we're gonna be late for the race.

94
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,780
Why are you so excited about the race? It's only for ponies.

95
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,260
Yeah, but I'm hoping I can be the announcer again. Just listen: 

96
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,860
- Fillies and gentlecolts, welcome to the annual running...
- Welcome to the annual Running of the Leaves! 

97
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:54,140
This is Pinkie Pie, your official eye-in-the-sky announcer.

98
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,290
Sorry, Spike. I guess that job is already taken.

99
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,600
As everypony knows, the running is a very important tradition, 

100
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,250
for without it, the autumn leaves of Equestria would never fall. 

101
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:11,920
So get ready, ponies. The Running of the Leaves will begin in five minutes. 

102
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,620
Pardon me, excuse me. Make way for the Iron Pony.

103
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,470
The Iron phony, you mean.

104
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,590
So, Applejack, you ready to win second place?

105
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,230
I'm ready to run a good, clean race.

106
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,710
Yeah, yeah...

107
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,360
You are not allowed to use your wings.

108
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,990
I could win this race with both wings tied behind my back. 

109
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,100
Trussed up like a turkey. Well, a turkey who can't fly, that is.

110
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,560
Very funny.

111
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,390
'least now we know we're racin' fair and square.

112
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,580
Racers! Please take your positions!

113
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,490
Pinkie Pie?

114
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,970
Hey, Spike! What's up? Oh wait, it me, I'm up!

115
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:06,020
Uh, yeah. I know you're doing the announcing today and stuff and... I'm sure you're gonna do a great job and all, but... 

116
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,360
- I was just wondering...
- What?

117
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,360
Forget it.

118
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,420
Spike! Would you like to be my co-reporter? We could comment on the action together.

119
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,290
We could?

120
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,290
Climb on up. 

121
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,560
Twilight? What in tarnation are you doin' up here?

122
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,800
I'm racing.

123
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,560
Good one, Twilight.

124
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,980
I'm not joking.

125
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,280
What? You're not an athlete, you're a... well... you're an egghead.

126
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,860
I am not an egghead, I am well read.

127
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,860
Egghead.

128
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,560
But have you ever run a race?

129
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,370
Well, no, but I do know a lot about running.

130
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,090
And you know this from...

131
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,770
Books. I've read several on the subject.

132
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:06,480
What'd you read, "The Egghead's Guide to Running"? Did you stretch out your eye muscles to warm up? 

133
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,180
Get it? Eye muscles.

134
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,700
Scoff if you must, Rainbow. But the running of the leaves is a Ponyville tradition, 

135
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,020
and since I'm here to learn, I've decided I should experience it myself.

136
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,690
Well, I think that's just dandy, Twilight. Good luck.

137
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,490
Yeah. See you at the finish line... Tomorrow.

138
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,230
All right, ponies, are you ready?

139
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,280
Get set.

140
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:43,310
And they're off!

141
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:49,420
Welcome to the official coverage of the Running of the Leaves! You know, Spike, despite its name, the leaves don't do any of the actual running. No, that's left to My Little Ponies.

142
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,930
Why, yes, Pinkie, it's the running of the ponies that causes the leaves to fall.

143
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,060
Those lazy, lazy leaves. 

144
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,500
But this year, the run is about more than the weather. It's about the race to the finish 

145
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,750
and the two runners who want to win it: Applejack and Rainbow Dash.

146
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:14,220
You know, Pinkie, these two ponies have a bit of a grudge match they're trying to settle. Trying to prove who's the most athletic.

147
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,110
Yes, and "grudge" rhymes with "fudge".

148
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,670
Yes it... does. What?

149
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,400
And I like fudge. But if I eat too much fudge I get a pudge and then I can't budge.

150
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,520
So... no fudge?

151
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:31,580
Oh, no thanks. I had a big breakfast. Let's check in with our two competitive ponies, Applejack and Rainbow Dash. 

152
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,270
Having come fast out of the gate, Applejack and Rainbow Dash are evenly matched running neck in neck. 

153
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,090
But what's this? Applejack is making a move, she's now ahead by a nose.

154
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,470
 But Rainbow Dash pulls at Applejack's have-it and takes the lead. She's ahead by half a nose. 

155
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,010
Or maybe three quarters of a nose. No, about sixty-three point seven percent of a nose... 

156
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,180
Roughly speaking. 

157
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,280
Applejack sees this move and pushes forth with her strong workhorse legs 

158
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,130
slinking ahead by three hundred and fifty noses!

159
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,650
Not so easy without wings, is it?

160
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,570
Come on, Rainbow. Show 'em a little dash.

161
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,330
Hold your horses, Pinkie! Rainbow Dash is catching up the frontrunner Applejack!

162
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:14,560
What an upset. I though Applejack had this in the bag.

163
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,090
You didn't think I was gonna let you off that easily, did you?

164
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,070
I don't believe it.

165
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,440
I know, it's beautiful, isn't it?

166
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,410
Not the scenery, Twilight. Rainbow Dash just tripped me.

167
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,490
- She did not.
- She did too!

168
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:42,020
She did not, and if you slowed down and looked where you're going, like me, you'd see that you tripped over a rock.

169
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,830
What? Oh, hayseed! 

170
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:48,460
Now I got a lot of ground to make up to catch Rainbow.

171
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,460
Just be careful! 

172
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,790
See you at the finish line!

173
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:07,280
I don't believe it. After a huge setback, Applejack is back at the front of the pack.

174
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,030
She's the head of the pack, all right. The pick of the litter! The CAT'S PAJAMAS!

175
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:17,290
 Oh wait, why would Applejack take some poor kitty's PJs? That's not very sporting of her.

176
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,540
OK... Let's get back to the race. 

177
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,010
Not so fast, Applejack! This race isn't over yet!

178
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,000
It is for you. 

179
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:40,290
I don't believe it, Applejack tripped me.

180
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,330
Don't you ponies ever look where you're going? You tripped on a stump. See?

181
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,550
Oh, I see. A big cheater is what I see.

182
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,210
Rainbow, Applejack would never cheat. It was just an accident.

183
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,210
Sure it was. 

184
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,520
I mean, yeah, I'm sure it was.

185
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,230
Remember, Rainbow, this is just a game.

186
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:05,390
Yes, but the rules have changed, and two can play at that game.

187
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,540
Welcome back, Ponyvillians, it's me, Pinkie Pie.

188
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,550
And Spike. Looks like Rainbow is doing her best to catch up.

189
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,160
I'm not sure how ketchup is going to help her in this contest. 

190
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,930
Now, in a hot dog eating contest it can make them doggies nice and slippery, but personally I prefer mustard. 

191
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,210
How about you, Spike?

192
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,140
I... like... pickles?

193
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:32,980
Aaand it looks like Applejack has found herself in quite a pickle as Rainbow overtakes her.

194
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,780
Look, ma, no wings.

195
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,610
As the racers enter Equestria's Whitetail Wood, Rainbow Dash is back in the lead.

196
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,660
Rainbow!

197
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,120
That little cheater did that on purpose.

198
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,530
 It's on.

199
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,790
Nice one, Rainbow.

200
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,580
Later!

201
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,010
Oh my, Whitetail Wood is just lovely. 

202
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,820
Hey, Rainbow, shouldn't you be up ahead?

203
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm sure I'll win now.

204
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,590
Except that the other racers just passed you.

205
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,470
Oh horse apples... See ya! 

206
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,000
Applejack, what are you doing up here?

207
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,860
There aren't even any trees.

208
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,550
I know but the sign's pointed this way... 

209
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,720
Rainbow. Mind giving me a lift? 

210
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,610
What a hay?! You said no flying!

211
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,480
No, I said no wings.

212
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,460
I must say, Spike, that this has been the most interesting Running of the Leaves in Equestria history!

213
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,100
With the most interesting announcing.

214
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:42,110
But it isn't the running that's been fascinating. It's the lack of running!

215
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:29,680
Forgive me, girls. I know I'm not an athlete, but shouldn't the Running of the Leaves actually involve running?

216
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,560
You know, I think Twilight's right.

217
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,570
You do?

218
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:38,060
Yeah! If you wanna beat me, you better... RUUUN! 

219
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,780
Once again, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are neck in neck, jockeying for position. 

220
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:50,980
Applejack inches ahead, now it's Rainbow, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack

221
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,580
Oh no, she di'int!

222
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,680
Oh yes, she di'id!

223
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,490
Cut it out!

224
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,020
No, you cut it out!

225
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,790
You started it.

226
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,880
And now I'm gonna finish it.

227
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
Oh no, you won't.

228
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,760
Oh yes, I will. 

229
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,330
That's it! All bets are off!

230
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,600
Oh no, you don't.

231
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:36,420
It's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash...

232
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,680
I won!

233
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,600
- No, I won!
- I won!

234
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,510
- You tied!
- Tied? For first?

235
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,850
For last.

236
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,640
 - LAST?
- Then, who won?

237
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,380
YOU?

238
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,850
Oh no, but I did get fifth place, which is rather good considering that I've never run a race before.

239
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,670
What? How's that even possible?

240
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,090
You ran so slow, and looked at the scenery.

241
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,640
Exactly. I paced myself, just like my book said. 

242
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,780
Then at the end, when all the other ponies were worn out, I sprinted to the finish.

243
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:21,160
I don't believe it. Twilight beat us.

244
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,900
Well, with all your horsing around, it was quite easy.

245
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,660
You're right, Twilight. Our behavior was just terrible.

246
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,260
We weren't very good sports.

247
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,940
Sounds to me that an important lesson was learned.

248
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,700
Princess Celestia?

249
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,670
What are you doin' here?

250
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:44,240
Fall is one of my favorite seasons, so I came to celebrate the Running of the Leaves.

251
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,720
I'm sorry you had to see us being such poor sport, Princess.

252
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,120
That's all right, Applejack. Anypony can get swept up in the excitement of competition.

253
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,270
It's important to remember that the friendship is always more important than the competition.

254
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,560
Exactly, Twilight. 

255
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,540
Now, unfortunately, because the two of you were busy tricking each other instead of shaking down leaves, 

256
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,810
many of the lovely trees of Equestria are still covered.

257
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,840
Why, Princess, I bet we can knock those leaves down for you lickety-split. 

258
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,160
Whaddya say, friend? Wanna go for another run?

259
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,820
I'd love to stretch my legs.
