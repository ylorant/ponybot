1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,070
Where'd I put that?

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,860
Ohh, I thought I already...

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,000
Ohh, and I can't forget I've got to--

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,100
Oh, how am I ever gonna get this done?

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,060
Are you sure I can't help?

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,440
I could--
- No!

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,980
Maybe just a--
- No thanks!

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,240
How about--
- Just stand over there.

9
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,500
But--
- Where you'll be out of the way.

10
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,970
Ribbon, Ribbon!
Where's the ribbon?!

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,320
- I got it!

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,600
Um...

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,980
I-I'll just go and stand over there,
where I'll be...

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,480
...out of the way.

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,460
<i>My Little Pony, My Little Pony...
Aaaaah...</i>

16
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,460
<i>My Little Pony,
I used to wonder what friendship could be.</i>

17
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,520
<i>My Little Pony,
until you all shared its magic with me.</i>

18
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,240
<i>Big adventure. Tons of fun.
A beautiful heart, faithful and strong.</i>

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,840
<i>Sharing kindness, it's an easy feat,
and magic makes it all complete!</i>

20
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:26,930
<i>My Little Pony,
Do you know you are my very best friends?</i>

21
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,430
Won't you at least let me help you clean up?

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,300
No. You've helped me quite enough.

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,900
I'm sorry, sis!

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,480
I just thought that if I could help, I might find my special gift
and finally earn my cutie mark.

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,960
I understand. It's just that...
I need this time to fill this order without any...

26
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,170
...complications.

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,830
Okay, all done.

28
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,120
Now, back to work.

29
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,200
I've lost a lot of time,
and I cannot have any more interruptions.

30
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,000
What now?!

31
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,200
- Oh, sorry. I thought the "open" sign
meant you were open,

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,260
but I must have been mistaken.

33
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,920
Fluttershy! Forgive me!

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,610
was so wrapped up in my work that I forgot you were
bringing Opalescence back from her grooming!

35
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,050
No worries, Rarity.
I've left her there in the basket.

36
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,720
Oh, she looks great!

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,270
I just don't understand how you're able to do it!

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,390
I can't get near her without
getting a swipe from her claws.

39
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,280
Ahh! Did you use...

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,760
The Stare on her?

41
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,630
Oh, no! I wouldn't! I couldn't!

42
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,420
I-I don't really have any control over when that happens.
I-It just happens. 

43
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,340
No, I'm just good with animals.
It's my special gift, you know?

44
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,430
Well, you should have a picture of Opal
as a cutie mark instead of those butterflies.

45
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,560
Maybe I can be good with animals, too!

46
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,060
Or not.

47
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,990
I'm sorry I can't invite you
 to stay and chat, Fluttershy.

48
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,620
I've bitten off a bit more
than I can chew with this order.

49
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,270
- But you're not eating anything.

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,450
- No, Sweetie,

51
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,690
it's an expression.

52
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,180
It means that I've taken on
more work than I can handle.

53
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,710
I've got twenty of these
special robes to make tonight!

54
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,250
They're due in Trottingham
 tomorrow morning.

55
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,760
See? I've lined them in a special gold silk.

56
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,740
It took so long to make, but I think it
adds just the right touch, don't you?

57
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,390
These are lovely,

58
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,830
but twenty by tonight?
How will you get it all done?

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,270
Well, I, uh...

60
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,450
Maybe I could... just...

61
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,230
...just stand over here and watch.

62
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,660
- I'll manage.

63
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,840
Well, maybe I should get out of
your mane so you can work.

64
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,240
Hi, Fluttershy!

65
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,190
Hi, Rarity!

66
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,600
Hello, uh, girls...

67
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,070
Hey, Sweetie Belle!

68
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,980
Scootaloo! Apple Bloom!

69
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,400
You ready for tonight?

70
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,130
Yup! Cutie mark planning session is a go!

71
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,260
Tonight is the night we each try
to find our own special talent.

72
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,070
Even if it takes us all night!

73
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,660
I'm ready!
You ready?

74
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,850
Very ready!

75
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,790
Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Rarity's!

76
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,850
Yay!

77
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,850
And... look what I made us!

78
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,820
- That's so cool!

79
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,870
What does that patch on your cape mean?

80
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,200
The Cutie Mark Crusaders! Yay!

81
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,230
We're on a crusade, a mission!

82
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,910
To find our cutie marks!

83
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,650
Yup. And look.
I lined them with this special gold silk.

84
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,840
It took sooo long to make,
but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?

85
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,270
Sweetie Belle!
What have you DONE?

86
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,640
That was the last of the gold silk!

87
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,180
Oh, now I'll have to make more!

88
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,040
Oh, I hope I can make more.

89
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,890
I'm gonna have to work all night!

90
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,320
Which means...

91
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,230
Sorry, girls, I'm afraid the Crusader
sleepover is cancelled.

92
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,450
WHAT?

93
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,040
I just won't have any time to watch you if
I want to get these robes delivered on time.

94
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:00,980
But--

95
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,590
No buts this time.

96
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,320
I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle;
it's just the way it has to be.

97
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,240
I, ah, I suppose I could
take them for the night.

98
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,710
I couldn't ask you to do that.

99
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,560
Oh, it's no problem at all.

100
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,740
Have you met my sister and her friends?

101
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,590
A problem is all it would be.

102
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,660
Did I have a problem with Opal?

103
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,080
You've seen how well I handle small creatures!

104
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,110
I suppose that's true...
and I do have a lot of work to do...

105
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,860
Come on, it'll be fun.

106
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,450
I assure you, they're quite a handful.

107
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,230
These sweet little angels?

108
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,280
Well...

109
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,590
All right.

110
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,990
Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover
at Fluttershy's cottage!

111
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,380
Yay!

112
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,940
So cute.

113
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,640
W-wait for me!

114
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,880
Oh, won't this be ever so fun?

115
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,840
We can have a nice little tea party,

116
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,670
and braid each other's tails,

117
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,550
and sit quietly and color,
and tell each other fairy tales, and--

118
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,660
Hello, Fluttershy.

119
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,690
Oh! Hello, Twilight.
Where are you off to?

120
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,630
I'm heading to the Everfree Forest, to Zecora's,
to get some of my favorite tea.

121
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,940
Th-the Everfree Forest?

122
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,510
Ah, you'll be careful, won't you?

123
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,620
Of course! How about you?
What are you doing with the girls?

124
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,430
Rarity has a big order to fill tonight, so I volunteered
to take the girls over to my cottage for a sleepover.

125
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,880
Wow. Sounds like everypony
has their hooves full today.

126
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,100
Taking care of those three fillies all by yourself?

127
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,630
 You sure you can handle it?

128
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,850
What? These sweet little angels?

129
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,140
They'll be no problem at all.

130
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,880
Wow! Look at this place!

131
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,170
What's that?
Are those tickets?

132
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,670
No problem at all.

133
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,980
Okay, girls, uh, what should we do?

134
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,600
I'm gonna get my mark first!

135
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,440
Girls?

136
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,770
Nuh-uh!
- I am!

137
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,700
Girls, okay, now settle --

138
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,980
- I'm staying up all night!

139
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,340
- Me too!
- Me three!

140
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,000
I-I know you're excited, but--

141
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,470
girls,

142
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,340
oh, oh, careful with the--

143
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,550
oh, ah, girls--

144
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,650
So! What do you wanna do?
Play a game?

145
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,810
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders!

146
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,530
- And we want to crusade for our cutie marks!

147
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,080
And, and, and, we, um--

148
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,890
Yeah! What they said!

149
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,830
Mmm, I don't know...

150
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,720
How about a nice quiet little tea party?

151
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,760
Or... we could go adventuring
in the Everfree Forest!

152
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,080
Yeah!

153
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,820
Oh, no. The Everfree Forest is much too dangerous.

154
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,520
It's filled with far too many strange creatures.

155
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,540
But you could go with us and
we could catch those creatures.

156
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,600
We could be, umm...

157
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,280
...creature catchers!

158
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,250
YAY! Cutie Mark Crusader creature catchers!

159
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,600
Arrrr... I am a dangerous creature
from the Everfree Forest! Rrrarr!

160
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,970
Halt, dangerous creature from the Everfree Forest.

161
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,680
I am Sweetie Belle, the creature catcher,
and I'm here to catch you!

162
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,530
You can never catch me!
I am far too powerful and dangerous!

163
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,860
You cannot run from me!

164
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,410
Um, oh, maybe that's not such a--

165
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,060
Now, girls...

166
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,030
How about we do some nice colouring? Dhh--

167
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,070
Come back, dangerous creature,
so I can catch you!

168
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,670
Never!

169
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,690
Careful... you don't...

170
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,620
...break anything.

171
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,400
Sorry, Fluttershy.

172
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,060
Yeah, sorry.

173
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,600
I guess we aren't creature catchers.

174
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,100
Oh, girls, it's okay. I--

175
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,040
I know! We could be
Cutie Mark Crusader carpenters!

176
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,550
C-carpenters?

177
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,490
Hammer!

178
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,340
- Hammer.

179
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,030
- Hammer!

180
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,960
- Hammer.

181
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,770
Hammer!

182
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,400
Hammer.

183
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,480
Um ... that doesn't look like a table.

184
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,090
We were making a table?

185
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,850
Somepony needs to put
this thing out of its misery.

186
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,790
We are definitely not Cutie Mark Carpenters.

187
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,520
Who wants a picture of a hammer
on their flank anyway?

188
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,660
Well, now that we've gotten
that out of the way,

189
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,990
how about a game?

190
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,270
A game?

191
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,640
It's called "Shhh!".

192
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,150
What's that?

193
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,430
Well, it's a game about who
can be quiet the longest.

194
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,530
Sound fun?

195
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,960
I'm the world champ, you know.
I bet you can't beat me!

196
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,380
I lose! - Me too!
- Me three!

197
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,950
Okay, now what can we do?

198
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,610
Oooh! How about Cutie Mark Crusader coal miners?

199
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,440
YEAH!

200
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,570
NO!

201
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,910
I mean, it's time for bed,
don't you think?

202
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,420
Aren't you excited to get all toasty and warm
in your snuggly-wuggly widdle beds?

203
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,810
Snuggly-wuggly?

204
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,650
But we have more crusading to do!

205
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,180
We've got plans!

206
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,840
And capes!

207
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,910
Um, okay, um. Maybe the crusading
can wait until morning?

208
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,830
When it's light? 
And not so... dark?

209
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,230
How are we gonna find
our special talent in our sleep?

210
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,750
Maybe you'll have a lovely little dream
about your special talent.

211
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,420
But we're not even tired!

212
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,880
How about I sing you a lullaby?

213
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,280
Mm-hmm, yeah!

214
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,210
<i>Hush now, quiet now.
It's time to lay your sleepy head.</i>

215
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,810
<i>Hush now, quiet now.
It's time to go to bed.</i>

216
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,760
I know this one!

217
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,630
Oh, how wonderful!
Why don't you sing it with me?

218
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,320
<i>Hush now! Quiet now!
It's time to lay your sleepy head!</i>

219
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,740
<i>Said hush now! Quiet now!
It's time to go to bed!</i>

220
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,580
- Okay, Sweetie, that was... 

221
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,150
<i>- Driftin' (driftin') off to sleep!
The exciting day behind you!</i>

222
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,990
<i>Driftin' (driftin') off to sleep!
Let the joy of dreamland find you!</i>

223
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,390
Thank you, Sweetie, um...

224
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,890
<i>- Hush now! Quiet now!
Lay your sleepy head!</i>

225
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:40,800
<i>Said hush now! Quiet now!
This's time to go to bed!</i>

226
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,200
What is that?

227
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,590
Girls!

228
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,190
Fluttershy, your chickens are on the loose!

229
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,700
I wonder what could
have caused that...

230
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,860
Don't worry, Fluttershy,
the Cutie Mark Crusaders will handle this!

231
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,440
Cutie Mark Crusader chicken herders!

232
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,390
Yay!

233
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,000
No, I don't think that's a-- ah, come back!

234
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,160
Please!

235
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,280
Come on, girls, the chickens are fine--

236
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:15,210
oh, girls, um...

237
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,770
GIRLS!

238
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,020
Come on.

239
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,130
In you go.

240
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,320
There's some good chickens.

241
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,210
Okay, you three. Isn't it about
time you got into bed?

242
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,370
- BUT--

243
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,620
Please?

244
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,520
So, no more crusading for tonight,
all right?

245
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,300
Yes, Fluttershy!
- We promise, Fluttershy!

246
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,590
- Good night, Fluttershy!

247
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,700
Okay, good night.

248
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,570
Okay, so what kind of
crusading do we do next?

249
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,670
- There's not much we
can do from this room...

250
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,080
unless we become Cutie Mark
Crusader cottage cleaners.

251
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,150
- N-no, thanks.

252
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,770
Well, we have to think of something.

253
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,570
We can't just waste this opportunity
to find out what our special talents are. 

254
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,240
Hey, girls!

255
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,300
Look!

256
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,800
Some of the chickens may have escaped!

257
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,000
Into the forest!

258
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,100
Cutie Mark Crusaders chicken rescuers are go!

259
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,870
It really wasn't THAT hard...

260
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,520
I mean, all I needed to do was
just show them who's in charge. 

261
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,660
Nothing's gonna get past Fluttershy!

262
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,330
Good with animals,
good with kids. 

263
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,380
Wait up!

264
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,560
Mmm, peace and quiet.

265
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,000
Too quiet.

266
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,430
Girls?

267
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,290
Girls?

268
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,490
Elizabeak! She's missing!

269
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,630
GIRLS?

270
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,130
Oh, no!

271
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,160
They must have gone looking for
my missing chicken!

272
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,720
Which means...
they must have gone into...

273
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,070
The Everfree Forest!

274
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,170
Those girls have really done it this time!

275
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,880
They've really bitten off
more than they can chew!

276
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,580
Oh, just like me!
I never should have offered to watch them.

277
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,360
Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!

278
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,370
What are you doing?

279
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,120
Calling for the chicken!

280
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,550
That is not how you call a chicken.

281
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,060
Oh, and you know how to call a chicken?

282
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,920
I know that's not the way.

283
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,940
Then show me.

284
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,610
I don't have to show you!

285
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,670
You're just chicken!

286
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,180
Am not!

287
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, wait, now I know
how to call a chicken!

288
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,590
Scootaloo!
Scoot-scootalooooo!

289
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,170
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.

290
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,130
You also forgot how
to call a chicken.

291
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,570
Why, you...

292
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,860
Come on, guys, we're not gonna find
the chicken or our cutie marks by arguing.

293
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,100
Maybe that's our special talent. Arguing!

294
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,180
Is not!

295
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,170
Is too!

296
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,020
- Is not!
- Is too!

297
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,240
Anything yet?

298
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,400
Nope.

299
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,620
- Darn.

300
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,250
Heeeere, chick-chick-chick-chick!

301
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,730
Girls?
Girls?

302
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,420
Oh! Get a hold of yourself, Fluttershy.

303
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,330
 Just put one hoof in front of the other.

304
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,400
Ahh! What was that?

305
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,750
Twilight?
I-is that you?

306
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,630
Oh, Twilight, it is you.

307
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,470
Thank goodness you're here.

308
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,530
I need your help. The girls are out here
somewhere, and I'm afraid that they're--

309
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,410
Oh! What's happened to you?

310
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,630
Oh, no! If you've been
turned to stone, it must mean--

311
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,280
Oh! oh, no, the girls!

312
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,930
Don't move;
I'll be back for you.

313
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:32,970
GIRLS! 

314
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,460
- It's not!
- It's too!

315
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,370
- It's not!
- It's too!

316
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,600
Girls! Our special talent is not arguing.

317
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,180
Besides, what would the cutie mark of somepony
whose talent is arguing even look like?

318
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,310
Girls?

319
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:47,990
 Girls?!

320
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,320
- Fluttershy?

321
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,260
Girls? Thank goodness I found you!

322
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,090
- Fluttershy, what--

323
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,160
- Girls, we have to leave the forest at once!

324
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,340
- But... we haven't found the chicken yet!

325
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,250
- There's no time for that.
There's a cockatrice on the loose!

326
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,660
A cocka what now?

327
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,390
A cockatrice!

328
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,970
It's a frightening creature with
the head of a chicken and the body of a snake.

329
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,060
Now, come on!

330
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,940
The head of a chicken
and the body of a snake?

331
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,140
That doesn't sound scary,
that sounds silly!

332
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:18,300
Well, if I ever saw one of them cockathingies
face-to-face, I'd laugh at how silly it was.

333
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,150
NO! Never look one in the eye.

334
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,330
If you look a cockatrice in the eye--

335
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,390
- The chicken!

336
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,750
Girls! Wait!

337
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,140
Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!

338
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,290
There it is!

339
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,140
Two chickens?

340
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,340
I thought only one escaped!

341
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,660
Grab them both!

342
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,630
See? Now we have to --

343
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:16,910
Girls.

344
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,700
Please.

345
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,650
Girls-- now listen to me.

346
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:20,770
I-- please!

347
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,690
Girls!

348
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,280
GIRLS! Behind me, NOW!

349
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,020
YOU!

350
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,240
Just who do you think you are,
going around turning others into stone?

351
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,780
You should be ashamed of yourself.

352
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,960
I have a mind to find your mother and
tell her what you've been up to, young man.

353
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,620
Now you go over there, and turn Elizabeak
and my friend Twilight back to normal, 

354
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,020
and don't ever let me catch you doing this again.

355
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,380
Do you understand me?

356
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,220
Are you girls all right? I was so worried!

357
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,600
Yeah, fine!

358
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,580
Thanks to that stare of yours.

359
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,170
You're like the queen of stares. You're the--

360
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,510
Stare Master!

361
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,780
We're sorry we snuck out
of the house and into the forest.

362
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,640
Yeah. We'll listen to you
from now on.

363
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,040
We promise.

364
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,140
Oh, you DO, do you?
Well, you better, or I'll give you...

365
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,460
...The Stare.

366
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:43,810
What...

367
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,250
What happened?

368
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,750
And that's when it brought you back from stone.

369
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,070
This is gonna make quite
a letter to the princess.

370
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,800
I was wrong about you.

371
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,050
You certainly do know
how to handle those girls.

372
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,080
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.

373
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,800
Hmm? How so?

374
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,230
I assumed that I'd be just as
good with kids as I am with animals.

375
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,070
Boy, was I wrong.

376
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,780
I really learned the hard way not to
bite off more than I could chew.

377
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,270
You and Rarity both.

378
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,940
Good morning, Rarity.

379
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,200
Did you finish all those capes?

380
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,040
Just delivered them.

381
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,530
I have to admit,

382
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,150
 if you hadn't come along,
I might not have.

383
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,580
Thanks again.

384
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,940
Won't you stay for some tea?

385
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,520
I really must get back to the shop and clean up.

386
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,800
Girls! Get your things.
Time to go.

387
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:36,770
Girls!

388
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,090
Girls!

389
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,140
Time to--

390
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:40,850
Girls!

391
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,130
Your things!

392
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,500
Girls!

393
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,530
It's time to--

394
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:47,690
GIRLS!

395
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:48,840
Allow me.

396
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:50,680
Girls?

397
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,160
Yes, Fluttershy.
- You called?

398
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,310
Go and get your things.
Rarity is here to see you home.

399
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,710
Of course, Fluttershy, right away!

400
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,650
Ah, huh, ah, how did you... how did you do that?

401
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,620
I guess I'm just as good
with kids as I am with animals.

402
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,790
Thank you, Fluttershy! Bye! Thank you Stare Master!

403
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,000
Ah, uh, speaking of which,
I could use your help with Opal.

404
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,170
Of course. How about later today?

405
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,200
How about now?
