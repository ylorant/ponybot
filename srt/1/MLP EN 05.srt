1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:06,380
Hoof-biting action overload! She was like a stunt superstar, flying higher and higher,

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,780
and then Rainbow Dash swooped down, swoosh, and right before she hit the ground, shoom, she pulled up, rrrmmm!

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,790
And then she looped around and around like fwoom fwoom fwoom fwoom fwoom fwoom fwoom.

4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,320
Rainbow Dash!

5
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,750
Pinkie Pie? Not again.

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,720
Rainbow Dash!

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,020
Not now, Pinkie Pie.

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,470
But, but Rainbow Dash...

9
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,340
I'm in the middle of something.

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,310
- But...
- I said not now...

11
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,100
I was gonna tell you to look out for that mountain.

12
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,740
Hi, I'm looking for Rainbow Dash. Have you seen her?

13
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,100
Hi there, have you seen Rainbow Dash? Okay, thanks anyway.

14
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,340
Twilight, have you seen Rainbow Dash anywhere?

15
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,530
Isn't she right up there?

16
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,980
Rainbow Dash!

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,320
That was close.

18
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,070
Hi!

19
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,310
Hi again.

20
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,750
I need a favor, Rainbow Dash.

21
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,490
Forget it.

22
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,900
I totally promise it would be totally fun.

23
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,610
Okay...

24
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,250
Over to the right. No no, a little to the left. Oh wait, back to the right.

25
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,430
Now a little leftish while staying rightly.

26
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,290
Stop.

27
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,610
Maybe a few inches to the south. Now a couple centimeters north.

28
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,590
Okay. One more smidgimeter to the...

29
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,150
Pinkie Pie!

30
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,040
I mean, perfect. Now wait for my signal.

31
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,490
Oh Rainbow Dash, we startled Spike into getting the hiccups.

32
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,600
Good one, Pinkie [hiccup] Pie. [hiccup] You're always pulling a fast one [hiccup] on me.

33
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,890
Oh no, you're not hurt are you?

34
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,550
Ne [hiccup] eh, don't be [hiccup] silly, dragons are [hiccup] fire-proof.

35
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,010
Oh, okay, good.

36
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,410
I wish the same thing [hiccup] were true with scrolls.

37
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,260
Have you ever seen anything more hilarious?

38
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,630
I can think of one thing.

39
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,950
I didn't take you for a prankster, Pinkie Pie.

40
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:46,220
Are you [hiccup] kidding? [hiccup] I love to pull pranks. It's all [hiccup] in good fun, and Pinkie Pie lo [hiccup] oves to have [hiccup] fun! [hiccup]

41
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,020
You know Pinkie Pie, you're not as annoying as I thought.

42
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,020
You wanna hang out?

43
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,140
That'd be [hiccup]

44
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,620
I'd really [hiccup] When do [hiccup]

45
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,440
I mean [hiccup] Why would you [hiccup]

46
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,650
A simple nod would do.

47
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,950
Is she even home?

48
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,410
I don't know, but I think she called.

49
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,540
There she is.

50
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,030
Land sakes!

51
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,880
Is someone over there? Who're we gonna squirt? Who're we gonna squirt?

52
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,610
Fluttershy.

53
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,260
WHAT?

54
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,460
Nonononononono, we can't prank Fluttershy.

55
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,880
I mean, she's so sensitive, it'll hurt her feelings, even our most harmless prank.

56
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,550
Yeah, you're right.

57
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,270
We need another victim who's made of tougher stuff. So, who's it gonna be?

58
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,320
I've got someone in mind.

59
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
The toughest around.

60
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,490
Awesome. Who? Who? Do I know them?

61
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,170
Oh, yes.

62
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,380
You're very close.

63
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,540
Good one, Pinkie Pie.

64
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:22,460
Rise and shine Rainbow Dash, it's a brand new day and got a lot of pranking to...

65
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,700
Mornin', Pink. Gilda, this is my gal pal, Pinkie Pie.

66
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,900
Hey. What's up.

67
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,230
Pinkie, this is my griffon friend, Gilda.

68
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,480
What's a griffon?

69
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,340
She's half-eagle, half-lion.

70
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,410
And all awesome. Raa.

71
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,150
Yeah, that's right.

72
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,000
Gilda's my best friend from my days at Junior Speedster flight camp.

73
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,390
Hey, remember the chant?

74
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,470
Chyeah, they made us recite it every morning, I'll never get that lame thing out of my head.

75
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,680
Sooo...

76
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,980
Only for you, Dash.

77
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,010
Junior Speedsters are our lives

78
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,010
Sky-bound soars and daring dives

79
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,010
Junior Speedsters it's our quest

80
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,340
To some day be the very best

81
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,700
Oh that was awesome, and you've given me a great idea for a prank. Gilda, you game?

82
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,440
Well, I groove on a good prank as much as the next griffon,

83
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,240
but Dash, you promised me we'd get a flying session in this morning.

84
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,670
Yeah, uh, well, Pinkie Pie, you don't mind, do you?

85
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,160
Gilda just got here. We'll catch up with you later.

86
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:40,290
Sure, no problem. Have fun you guys, so I'll... just catch up with you...

87
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,770
...later.

88
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,220
Wow, that was sweet. Just like old times.

89
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,790
Yeah, only faster. So now what?

90
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,680
Hey there.

91
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,850
It's later. And I caught up.

92
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,570
Pinkie Pie, you are so random.

93
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,690
Hey Dash, think you got enough gas left to beat me to that cloud?

94
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,080
A race? You are so on.

95
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,460
One, two, three, go.

96
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,650
I win.

97
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,050
As if. I won, dude.

98
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,240
- No way.
- Yes way.

99
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,640
- Come on, I was way ahead of you.
- I don't think so.

100
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,330
- Please, dream on.
- Remember back in camp? I...

101
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,770
- There is no way you beat me.
- Whatever.

102
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:46,490
Wow guys, that was really cool, but I think Rainbow Dash beat you by a teeny weeny itty bitty hair,

103
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,490
or a teeny weeny itty bitty feather.

104
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,160
See? Good thing Pinkie Pie's here to keep you honest, G.

105
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,320
OK, Dash. Last one to that cloud up there is a gnarly dragon egg.

106
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,130
Go!

107
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,680
I think the high altitude is making you dizzy.

108
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,130
Wait, guys...

109
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,720
Wow, you guys almost got away from me that time.

110
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:24,200
So, Dash, got any new moves in your tricktionary, or are you 100% old school?

111
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,920
New moves? Heh, sit back G, this is gonna take a while.

112
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,310
Hey Pinkie, c'mere.

113
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,870
Yeah?

114
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,380
Don't you know how to take get lost for an answer?

115
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,330
Dash doesn't need to hang with a dweeb like you now that I'm around.

116
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:46,110
You're dorkin' up the skies, Stinkie Pie, so make like a bee and BUZZ OFF.

117
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,910
Try matching that.

118
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,890
Hey, where's Pinkie Pie and her crazy contraption?

119
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,880
She left. Something about being busy as a bee.

120
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:11,970
So Pinkie Pie, are you sure that this friend of Rainbow Dash is really so mean?

121
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:17,430
Yeah, she keeps stealing Rainbow Dash away, she pops my balloons, and she told me to buzz off.

122
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,620
I've never met a griffon this mean. Well actually I've never met a griffon at all.

123
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,560
But I bet if I had, she wouldn't have been as mean and grumpy as Gilda.

124
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
You know what I think, Pinkie Pie?

125
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,840
Well, I think... you're jealous.

126
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,780
Jealous?

127
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,270
Green with envy. Well, in your case, pink with envy.

128
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:42,570
Well, yes. Jealous. Listen Pinkie, I don't want to upset you, but just because Rainbow Dash has another friend doesn't make Gilda a grump.

129
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,970
I mean, perhaps it's you, Pinkie, who needs to improve her attitude.

130
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:52,150
Improve my attitude? But I... D... B.. Th... Gilda's a... D... Are you seri...

131
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:03,890
Maybe Twilight is right. Maybe Gilda isn't a big meanie grumpy mean-meanie-pants.

132
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,100
Maybe I'm just a big jealous judgmental jealous-jealousy-pants.

133
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,920
That was sweet.

134
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:24,110
I gotta take care of a few weather jobs around here. Shouldn't take long. Just, uh, hang out in town and I'll come find you.

135
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,820
That's cool, I guess. I'm gonna go chow down.

136
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
Later.

137
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,620
A rattler, a rattler!

138
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,100
Run for the hills! Everybody forsake yourselves!

139
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,870
This stuff ain't fresh, dude.

140
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,790
Poor Granny Smith, she didn't know it was a joke. How mean.

141
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:57,850
No no, I can't misjudge her. It was kind of a funny prank, I guess.

142
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,000
I did misjudge her. She's not only a meanie mean-pants, she's also a thief.

143
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,770
Nonononono, she might give it back. It's just a joke.

144
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:17,610
Alright little ones, this way, this way. Mama duck is free and clear.

145
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,870
Please excuse me.

146
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,660
I'm walkin' here.

147
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,080
-  I'm sorry. A-a-I was just trying to...

148
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,800
- "I'm sorry, I'm sorry"

149
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,000
Why don't you just watch where you're going, stupid?

150
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,290
B-b-b-but I... I...

151
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,750
Please, all these lame ponies are driving me buggy. I gotta bail.

152
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:55,460
She's a grump, and a thief, and a bully. The meanest kind of mean meanie-pants there is.

153
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:01,270
I can take it, but no one treats Fluttershy like that. No one.

154
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:07,000
This calls for extreme measures, Pinkie Pie style.

155
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,710
Welcome, welcome. Welcome.

156
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,080
Who's this Gilda I've heard nothing about?

157
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,060
I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash. A griffon, so rare.

158
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,520
You've met Gilda, right? What's she like?

159
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,710
Well, I'll tell you later, Twilight.

160
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,940
Welcome. Welcome.

161
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:35,140
Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda. Do you really think it's a good idea? I mean...

162
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:41,020
Don't worry your pretty little head about mean old Gilda, your auntie Pinkie Pie has got it all taken care of.

163
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,130
I'm a year older than you.

164
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,630
Gilda! I'm so honored to throw you one of my signature Pinkie Pie parties,

165
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,530
and I really truly sincerely hope you feel welcome here amongst all us pony folk.

166
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,780
Oh, Pinkie Pie, the old hoof-shake buzzer. You are a scream.

167
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,090
Yeah, uh, good one, Pinkie Pie.

168
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,880
Come on G, I'll introduce you to some of my other friends.

169
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,890
Right behind you Dash. I know what you're up to.

170
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,610
Great.

171
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,670
I know what you're planning.

172
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,680
Well I hope so. This wasn't supposed to be a surprised party.

173
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,710
I mean, I've got my eye on you.

174
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,150
And I got my eye on you.

175
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:37,540
Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda, a long-time dear friend of Rainbow Dash.

176
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,380
Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville.

177
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,680
Please help yourself.

178
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,020
Vanilla lemon drops. Don't mind if I do.

179
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,090
HOT!

180
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,090
G, the punch.

181
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:08,340
Well whaddya know, pepper in the vanilla lemon drops, and the punch served in a dribble glass.

182
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,090
Priceless. Priceless.

183
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,340
Yeah, hilarious.

184
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,180
Hey G, look, presents.

185
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,760
Spittin' snakes. Heh, somepony pulled there prank on me last month.

186
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,140
I bet I know who that was.

187
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,140
You do?

188
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,610
Cake time everypony.

189
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,330
Hey, can I blow out the candles?

190
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,580
Why don't we let Gilda blow out the candles, Spike. She is the guest of honor after all.

191
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,080
Exactly.

192
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,810
Re-lighting birthday candles, I love that prank. What a classic.

193
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,890
Now, I wonder who could've done that.

194
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,140
Yeah, I wonder.

195
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,110
Wwho cares. This cake is amazing.

196
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,270
Spike!

197
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,780
What? It was great, try some.

198
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,340
Hey G, you're not upset about some silly candles, are you?

199
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,610
No way Dash, like I said, I'm down with a good prank.

200
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,740
Come on then, let's have some cake.

201
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,660
Hey, I'm watching you. Like a hawk.

202
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,840
Why? Can't you watch me like a griffon?

203
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,530
Hey y'all, it's pin the tail on the pony. Let's play.

204
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:54,250
Oh, my favorite game. Can I go first? Can I have the purple tail?

205
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,300
Well I am the guest of honor, I'll have the purple tail.

206
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,900
Yeah, Gilda should definitely go first. Let's get you blindfolded.

207
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,430
Hey what are you doing?

208
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,560
We're spinning you around and around and then you pin the tail on the pony.

209
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,730
Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail.

210
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,550
"Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail".

211
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,830
Heh, yeah right, this is another prank isn't it. I'm going this way.

212
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,280
Wait. The poster is this...

213
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,650
Gilda? You pinned the tail on the wrong end.

214
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,750
This is your idea of a good time? I've never met a lamer bunch of dweebs in all my life.

215
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:45,250
And Pinkie Pie, you, you are queen lame-o with your weak little party pranks,

216
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:53,400
do you really think you can make me lose my cool? Well, Dash and I have ten times as much cool as the rest of you put together.

217
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,980
Come on Dash, we're bailing on this pathetic scene.

218
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,960
Come on Rainbow Dash. I said, we're leaving.

219
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,860
You know Gilda, I was the one who set up all those weak pranks at this party.

220
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,170
What?

221
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,830
So I guess I'm queen lame-o.

222
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,270
Come on, Dash, you're joshing me.

223
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,750
They weren't all meant for you specifically, it was just some luck that you set them all off.

224
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,220
I shoulda known, that dribble cup had Rainbow Dash written all over it.

225
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:30,640
No way. It was Pinkie Pie, she set up this party to trip me up, to make a fool of me.

226
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,750
Me? I threw this party to improve your attitude. I thought a good party might turn that frown upside down.

227
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,060
And you sure didn't need any help making a fool of yourself.

228
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,980
You know, this is not how I thought my old friend would treat my new friends.

229
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:50,350
If being cool is all you care about, maybe you should go find some new cool friend someplace else.

230
00:19:51,780 --> 00:20:00,040
Yeah? Well you, you, you are such an, a flip-flop: cool one minute and lame the next.

231
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,500
When you decide not to be lame anymore, gimme a call.

232
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,860
Not cool.

233
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,390
Wow, talk about a party pooper.

234
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,800
- Wow, what was that about?
- Awkward.

235
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,690
I'm sorry everypony, for bringing Gilda here. I didn't know how rude she was.

236
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:23,460
And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry she ruined that awesome party you put on for her.

237
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,790
Hey, if you want to hang out with party poopers, that's your business.

238
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,640
I'd rather hang out with you. No hard feelings?

239
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,640
No hard feelings.

240
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:42,990
Hey Pinkie, sorry I accused you of misjudging Gilda. Looks likes I'm the one who misjudged you.

241
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,650
It's okay Twilight, even you can't be a super smart smarty smart-pants all the time.

242
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,470
Come on everypony, there's still a whole lotta partying to fit in.

243
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,330
Dearest Princess Celestia, today I learned that it's hard to accept

244
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:01,870
when somepony you like wants to spend time with somepony who's not so nice.

245
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:07,690
Though it's impossible to control who your friends hang out with, it is possible to control you own behavior.

246
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,810
Just continue to be a good friend.

247
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:14,690
In the end the difference between a false friend and one who's true will surely come to light.

248
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,780
Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.

249
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,250
Dear Twilight Sparkle, my most faithful student.

250
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,030
Wrong ink.
