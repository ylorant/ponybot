1
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,830
Thank you little squirrel,

2
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:23,460
but remember: these flowers are for Princess Celestia. Only the prettiest ones will do.

3
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,670
Hello little guy. I've never seen anything like you before.

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,690
Are you hungry?

5
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,140
Here you go.

6
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,320
I guess you were hungry.

7
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:10,560
You're the cutest thing ever. I can't wait to show you to my friends.

8
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,600
Hurry up Spike! This place isn't gonna clean itself.

9
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,240
It also didn't mess itself up.

10
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,970
Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!

11
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,630
I thought this was just an unofficial casual visit.

12
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,250
There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty.

13
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,760
I want this place to be spotless, and you've barely made a dent in the clutter.

14
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,520
Maybe you should, ugh, start reading them... one at a time--wooah hoaw! Aw.

15
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,140
Everything's gotta be perfect. No time for fooling around.

16
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,460
You know, this would be an awful lot easier if there weren't two of us here, getting under each other's feet.

17
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,350
Great idea. You clean, I'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming.

18
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,990
Or maybe I should...

19
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,620
What happened to the rest of her name?

20
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,740
We couldn't fit it all in.

21
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,420
You can't hang a banner that says "Welcome Princess Celest". Take it down and try again.

22
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,980
That looks perfect. Keep up the good work.

23
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,070
Hello Mr and Mrs Cake. How's the banquet coming?

24
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,790
It would be coming a little better if...

25
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,770
Pinkie! What are you doing? Those sweets are supposed to be for the princess.

26
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,140
I know. That's why I'm tasting them.

27
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,420
Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to tosh th' royal thung,

28
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:46,870
and I, Pinkie Pie, declare that these treats are fit for a king, or a queen, or a princess.

29
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,940
Twilight, Pinkie, you won't believe...

30
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,240
oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?

31
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,390
No, not at all. Come on in and make yourself at home.

32
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,170
What's going on, Fluttershy?

33
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,510
You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest.

34
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,630
Come on out, little guy. It's okay.

35
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,520
Three?

36
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,040
They're amazing. What are they?

37
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,890
I'm not sure. I'm also not sure where these other two came from.

38
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:29,130
I'll take one off your hooves. I've never seen anything so... adorable.

39
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,900
Besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for Spike so he won't bother me so much while I'm studying.

40
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,300
Pinkie, do you want the other one?

41
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,990
A parasprite? Are you kidding?

42
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,720
- A para-what?
- How could you not like...

43
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,190
Now I gotta find a trombone.

44
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,490
A what?

45
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,410
A trombone, you know...

46
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,950
Typical Pinkie.

47
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,610
Stand still, Rainbow Dash.

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,920
I caaan't, I need to flyyy. This is waaay too boring for me.

49
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,990
Do you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not?

50
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,920
Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous.

51
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,890
Thank you Twilight. Nice to know someone appreciates my talents.

52
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,510
Ssooo boooring.

53
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,160
What's that sound, Twilight?

54
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,520
What are they?

55
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,950
The better question is, where did they come from? I only had one a minute ago.

56
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,490
I'll take one.

57
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,180
Me too, oh, they're perfect.

58
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,330
Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?

59
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,490
Girls! Hello! This is important.

60
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,450
Thanks a lot.

61
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:11,070
The decorations, the banquet, I really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow.

62
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,930
What's there to worry about? 

63
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,240
Spike!

64
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,670
Wake up! What happened?

65
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,730
What's going on?

66
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,460
Where did they come from?

67
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,900
I don't know. The little guy got hungry in the night, so I gave him a snack,

68
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,080
 but... I have no idea where these others came from. 

69
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,820
Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work!

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,460
The princess will be here in a few hours.

71
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,890
Spike, help me round up these little guys.

72
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,030
What does it look like I'm doin'? Ooow, waaah!  

73
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,260
I know, I know, "stop fooling around". 

74
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,620
Get off me!

75
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:08,030
Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful.

76
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,800
 Are you okay?

77
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,740
Gross gross gross. 

78
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,060
No creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique.

79
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,070
Look Rarity, Applejack loaned me a harmonica. 

80
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,120
Isn't that great?

81
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,280
And not a moment too soon.

82
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,420
Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now.

83
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,740
And I'm not? You know how many more instruments I gotta find? A lot, that's how many. 

84
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,140
Now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time.

85
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,590
Please, Pinkie, I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt. I've got a real problem.

86
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:01,170
You've got a real problem alright, and a banjo is the only answer. 

87
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,410
I see we're having the same problem.

88
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,740
Fluttershy knows everything about animals, I'm sure she can tell us how to stop them from multiplying.

89
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,740
...or not.

90
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,170
Do something Fluttershy, can't you control them?

91
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,560
I tried everything I know: I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely and...

92
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,980
If we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster.

93
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,780
If you ask me it's already a total disaster.

94
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:03,040
Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy, but I still can't figure why y'need so many. 

95
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,060
What do we do?

96
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,960
I got it! No pony can herd like Applejack.

97
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,660
Yeah! We can drive 'em back into the forest.

98
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,220
I'l rustle 'em up, but I need everypony's help to do it. 

99
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,230
Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there. I'll herd the little critters straight at ya like a funnel. 

100
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,350
Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy stay on top of 'em, don't let 'em fly away.

101
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,850
Aye aye.

102
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,050
Alright y'all, here goes nothin'. 

103
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,810
Look out Rarity, that one's fixin' to get away. 

104
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,420
Keep a lean on 'em, Rainbow Dash. 

105
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,560
Hold on girls, we're almost there.

106
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,560
- Pinkie!
- Twilight, we don't have much time.

107
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,490
You're telling me? The princess could arrive at any moment.

108
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,950
Exactly. That's why I need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some maracas.

109
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:13,220
Maracas? Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas.

110
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,590
You're right! Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal. Follow me. 

111
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,790
I said, follow me!

112
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,080
Pinkie Pie, you are so random.

113
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,010
And you are all so stubborn.

114
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:34,340
Forget her ladies. Focus. Head 'em up and move 'em out. 

115
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,090
Alright.

116
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,430
We did it. Nice work, Applejack.

117
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,580
Couldn't a'done it without y'all.

118
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,610
Now let's get back and clean the mess they made, before the princess arrives. 

119
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:01,380
Okay, everyone knows what to do, right? We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time. 

120
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,380
Where did they come from?

121
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,590
I may have kept just one. 

122
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:19,060
I couldn't help myself. They're just so cute.

123
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,020
We don't have time to keep rounding up these things. What do we do now?

124
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,950
We call in the weather patrol.

125
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,400
Time to take out the adorable trash.

126
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,260
Way to go, Rainbow Dash. 

127
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,800
Looks like our problems are solved.

128
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,330
They will be with these cymbals.

129
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,550
 Hey! Give me those back!

130
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,600
I can't hold it! She's breaking up.

131
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,850
Pinkie Pie, what have you done?

132
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,340
I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done.

133
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:34,250
Will you forget about your silly instruments for one second? You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville.

134
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:43,400
Me? Ruin? I'm not the ruiner, I'm the ruinee! Or is it ruiness? Ruinette?

135
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,880
Come on girls, there's no reasoning with that one. She's a few apples short of a bushel.

136
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,910
Hey! I'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof. 

137
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,040
If you just slow down and listen to me! 

138
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,580
What do we do? They're eating all the food in town.

139
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,150
My apples!

140
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,630
We've gotta do something. 

141
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,140
I got it! I'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food.

142
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,770
Look, tamborines! If you can all just...

143
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,160
Hey, it worked. They're not eating the food anymore.

144
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:25,610
Oh no... if they get inside my store... Every pony for herself! 

145
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,070
My outfits! 

146
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,320
Go on, shoo! Get out of here. Naughty! Naughty!

147
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,620
I'll save you!

148
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,340
No woodland creature is gonna eat the Apple Family's crop.

149
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,540
Brace yourself y'all, here they come. 

150
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,880
Didn't see that one comin'. 

151
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,620
Help!

152
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,640
They're eating the words.

153
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,460
Help.

154
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,280
Have you gone mad?

155
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:59,660
Zecora, these little guys are devouring Ponyville, and the princess is on her way. Can you help us, please?

156
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:05,860
Oh, monster of so little size. Is that a parasprite before my eyes?

157
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,830
I don't know! Is it?

158
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:16,980
Tales of crops and harvests consumed. If these creatures are in Ponyville, you're doomed.

159
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,020
Oh no, here she comes.

160
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,610
Okay, here's the plan. Rainbow Dash, you distract them.

161
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,740
Good. Everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of Ponyville right over there. We've got less than a minute. 

162
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,420
Zecora was right, we're doomed. 

163
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:59,990
Oh no, the princess's procession is here. It's all over. 

164
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,870
Pinkie? We're in the middle of a crisis here. This is no time for your... 

165
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,620
nonsense? 

166
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,490
Look.

167
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,390
Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil.

168
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,110
Hello, princess.

169
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,100
So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends.

170
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:04,180
So... how's the trip? Get much traffic?

171
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,550
What is this? 

172
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,720
These creatures are adorable.

173
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,290
They're not that adorable.

174
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:20,850
I'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of Ponyville have organized a parade in honor of my visit.

175
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,850
Parade? 

176
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,890
Yes, the parade.

177
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:29,060
Unfortunately, that visit is going to have to wait for another time. 

178
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:35,760
I'm afraid an emergency has come up in Fillydelphia. Apparently there's been some sort of infestation.

179
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,940
An... infestation?

180
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:47,460
Yes, a swarm of incredibly bothersome creatures has invaded the poor town. I'm sorry Twilight, to have to put you all through so much trouble.

181
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,240
Trouble? What trouble?

182
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,880
Before I have to go, would you care to give me your latest report on the magic of friendship in person?

183
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,120
My... report?

184
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,040
Haven't you learned anything about friendship?

185
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:11,850
Actually, I have. I've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it. 

186
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:16,190
It's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives.

187
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,430
Even when they don't always seem to make sense.

188
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:26,280
I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle, and I'm very impressed with your friends as well. 

189
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,410
It sounds like you're all learning so much from each other.

190
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,030
Thank you, princess. 

191
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,250
Hey, what happened to the princess?

192
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,910
Emergency in Fillydelphia.

193
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,640
Some sort of infestation.

194
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,030
Oh no! Have they got parasprites too? Well, have tuba, will travel.

195
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,800
I think the princess can handle it.

196
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,180
So you knew what those critters were all along, huh Pinkie Pie?

197
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:01,430
Well DUH, why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments? I tried to tell you.

198
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,440
We know Pinkie Pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen.

199
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,180
You're a great friend, even if we don't always understand you.

200
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,390
Thanks guys, you're all great friends too, even when I don't understand me.

201
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:21,870
You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia, and more importantly, you saved Ponyville. 

202
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,280
Or not.
