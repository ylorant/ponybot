1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,834
Come on, Twilight, you can do it!

2
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:05,866
Okay, here goes.

3
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:12,279
Ha ha! Ya did it!

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,473
Growing magic, that's number twenty five. Twenty five different types of tricks and counting.

5
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:20,814
And I think this is the best trick so far.

6
00:00:20,815 --> 00:00:27,366
Hello, Rarity. What's that? Aw, it's nothin', just my awesome moustache.

7
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:33,394
Sorry, Romeo. As attractive and enticing as you look, it's just for practice and it's gotta go.

8
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:38,096
Wait!
Aw, rats.

9
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:19,804
Twenty five, Twilight. Twenty five different kinds of tricks and counting.

10
00:01:19,805 --> 00:01:24,559
I thought unicorns were only supposed to have a little magic that matches their special talent.

11
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,032
True, for ponies whose talents are for things like cooking or singing or math,

12
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:32,125
but what if a unicorn's special talent is magic?

13
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:35,200
Like you, Twilight, and you know a ton of magic.

14
00:01:35,201 --> 00:01:41,031
Oh, Spike, stop. I'm sure there are lots of ponies right here in Ponyville that know just as much magic as me.

15
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:46,208
Are you kiddin'? I don't think there's another unicorn in all of Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight.

16
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:49,292
Gangway! Comin' through!

17
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:53,862
Augh! Snip, Snails! What's goin' on?

18
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:58,603
What, haven't you heard? There's a new unicorn in town!

19
00:01:58,604 --> 00:02:03,942
Yeah! They say she's got more magical powers than any other unicorn ever!

20
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:04,943
Really?

21
00:02:04,944 --> 00:02:08,322
Aw, no way, that honor goes to Twilight here.

22
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:10,739
Where is this unicorn?

23
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,385
- Ho, she's in the town square. Come on!
- Yeah! Come on!

24
00:02:18,226 --> 00:02:27,812
Come one, come all! Come and witness the amazing magic of the Great and Powerful Trixie!

25
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:41,685
Watch in awe as the Great and Powerful Trixie performs the most spectacular feats of magic ever witnessed by pony eyes!

26
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:47,391
My, my, my! What boasting!

27
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:53,466
Come on, no pony's as magical as Twili-- Twi-- Twi-- Oh!

28
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:56,741
Hey, Rarity, I, uh-- Moustache!

29
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,639
There's nothing wrong with being talented, is there?

30
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,286
Nothin' at all, 'ceptin' when someone goes around showin' it off like a school filly with fancy new ribbons.

31
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:11,297
Just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does not make one better than the rest of us.

32
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:14,902
Especially when ya got me around being better than the rest of us.

33
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:20,427
Eh, I mean, yeah, uh, magic shmagic. Boo!

34
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:26,335
Well, well, well, it seems we have some neigh sayers in the audience.

35
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:33,043
Who is so ignorant as to challenge the magical ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie?

36
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:38,910
Do they not know that they're in the presence of the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria?

37
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,788
Just who does she think she is?

38
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,056
Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here is--

39
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,157
Spike! Shhh!

40
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:46,998
What? What's wrong?

41
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:52,031
You see the way they reacted to Trixie? I don't want anyone thinking I'm a show-off.

42
00:03:56,071 --> 00:04:01,353
So, Great and Powerful Trixie, what makes you think you're so awsome, anyway?

43
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:10,718
Heh, why, only the Great and Powerful Trixie has magic strong enough to vanquish the dreaded Ursa Major!

44
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,264
- What?
- No way!

45
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:26,434
When all hope was lost, the ponies of Hoofington had no one to turn to, but the Great and Powerful Trixie stepped in,

46
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:34,864
and with her awsome magic vanquished the Ursa Major and sent it back to its cave deep within the Everfree Forest!

47
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:37,482
Saw, sweet!

48
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:38,283
That settles it.

49
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:45,545
Trixie truly is the most talented, the most magical, the most awsome unicorn in Ponyville.

50
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:48,852
No, in all of Equestria!

51
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:52,117
How do you know? You didn't see it! And besides, Twi--

52
00:04:54,861 --> 00:05:02,327
It's true, my enthusiastic little admirer. Trixie is most certainly the best in Ponyville.

53
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:10,377
Don't believe the Great and Powerful Trixie? Well then, I hereby challenge you, Ponyvillians.

54
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:13,912
Anything you can do, I can do better.

55
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:21,770
Any takers? Anyone? Or is Trixie destined to be the greatest equine who has ever lived !?

56
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:30,538
Please! She's unbearable! Ya gotta show her! Ya just gotta!

57
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:35,311
There's no way I'm going to use my magic now, Spike. Especially since--

58
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:38,493
Hmm, how about -- you!

59
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:49,206
Well, how about it? Hm? Is there anything you can do that the Great and Powerful Trixie can't?

60
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:53,271
- I-- I--
- Well, little hayseed?

61
00:05:53,272 --> 00:05:56,204
That's it! I can't stand for no more of this!

62
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:57,505
You show her, AJ!

63
00:05:57,806 --> 00:06:00,754
Can your magical powers do this?

64
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:16,782
Top that, missy.

65
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:23,471
Oh ye of little talent. Watch and be amazed at the magic of Trixie!

66
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:44,671
Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie prevails.

67
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:48,013
There's no need to go struttin' around and showin' off like that.

68
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:51,487
- Oh?
- That's my job!

69
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,781
They don't call me 'Rainbow' and 'Dash' for nothin'!

70
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:26,851
When Trixie is through, the only thing they'll call you is loser.

71
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,338
I think I'm -- gonna be sick.

72
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:48,681
Seems like any pony with a dash of good sense would think twice before tussling with the Great Trixie.

73
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:57,593
What we need is another unicorn to challenge her. Someone with some magic of her own.

74
00:07:57,594 --> 00:08:01,367
Yeah! A unicorn to show this unicorn who's boss.

75
00:08:01,368 --> 00:08:04,468
A real unicorn to unicorn tussle.

76
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:10,598
Enough. Enough, all of you. I take your hint, but Rarity is above such nonsense.

77
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:16,162
Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace.

78
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:22,444
Ooh, what's the matter? Afraid you'll get a hair out of place in that rat's nest you call a mane?

79
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:25,102
Oh, it. Is. On!

80
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:30,884
You may think you're tough with all your so-called powers, but there's more to magic than your brutish ways.

81
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,807
A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle.

82
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:37,017
A unicorn needs to have style.

83
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:41,984
A unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty.

84
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:49,947
Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her! She's strong, she's beautiful, she's--

85
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,950
Quick! I need a mirror! Get me a mirror! What did she do to my hair? I know she did something terrible to my hair!

86
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:00,651
Nothing.

87
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:01,652
It's fine.

88
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:02,853
It's gorgeous.

89
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:05,981
It's green.
What?

90
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:14,358
No. Green hair! Not green hair! That's an awful, awful color!

91
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:17,180
Well, I never!

92
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:22,513
Well, Twilight, guess it's up to you. Come on, show her what you're made of.

93
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:25,021
What do you mean? I'm nothing special.

94
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,325
Yes, you are! You're better than her!

95
00:09:27,326 --> 00:09:28,926
I'm not better than anyone.

96
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:35,525
Hah! You think you're better than the Great and Powerful Trixie? You think you have more magical talent?

97
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:39,886
Well, come on, show Trixie what you've got. Show us all.

98
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:45,769
Who, me? I'm just your run of the mill citizen of Ponyville. No powerful magic here.

99
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,333
I, uh... I think I hear my laundry calling. Sorry.

100
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:52,842
Twilight?

101
00:09:52,843 --> 00:10:01,421
Ha! Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie has proven herself to be the most amazing unicorn in all of Equestria.

102
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:04,664
Was there ever any doubt?

103
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:14,835
Here's the smoothie you asked for, with extra hay, just how you like it.

104
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:23,532
Yes?

105
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:27,630
Ooh, tell us another story oh Great and Powerful Trixie.

106
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:32,620
Yeah, tell us about how you vanquished the Ursa Major.

107
00:10:32,921 --> 00:10:38,668
Bah! Trixie is far too exhausted from performing feats beyond imagination.

108
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:41,621
Begone with you until morning.

109
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:45,672
Oh, of course, Great and Powerful Trixie.

110
00:10:45,673 --> 00:10:49,240
Anything you say. We are at your beck and call.

111
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:52,814
What are you two doin'?

112
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:55,377
Just bringin' the Gee of Pee Tee a--

113
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:56,078
The what?

114
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,169
The Great and Powerful Trixie.

115
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:01,297
Just bringin' her a smoothie.

116
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:06,089
How can you fall for her lameness? She's just a show-off. Unlike Twilight, who--

117
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:11,937
The Great and Powerful Trixie vanquished an Ursa Major. Can your Twilight claim that?

118
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,065
Oh really? Were you guys actually there?

119
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,968
Well, eh, uh... no, but--

120
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,301
But nothin'. The proof is in the pudding.

121
00:11:22,243 --> 00:11:23,844
I like pudding.

122
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:31,496
Look, unless an Ursa Major comes waltzing up the street for Trixie to vanquish, I am not gonna believe a word she says!

123
00:11:31,497 --> 00:11:32,697
And neither should you!

124
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:39,052
Hm, an ursa walkin' up the street, hay? Snails! Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

125
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:44,171
Why is it they call it a flea market when they don't really sell fleas?

126
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:46,759
Yeah, uh... oh, come on!

127
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:55,128
Twilight, would you put down that book and just listen to me?

128
00:11:55,129 --> 00:12:01,803
Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's bragging, Spike? If I go out there and show off my magic, I run the risk of losing them as friends.

129
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:06,385
It's not the same thing, Twilight. You'll be using your magic to stand up for your friends!

130
00:12:06,386 --> 00:12:08,673
No, Spike, it's exactly the same.

131
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:13,020
Come on, Twilight, any one of these tricks, even the teeniest, would be enough to show up Trixie.

132
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:15,782
I don't want to be seen as a bragger like Trixie.

133
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:19,831
But you're the best!

134
00:12:19,832 --> 00:12:22,365
Uh. Please, Spike, I said no!

135
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:26,158
If that's the way you wanna be, fine.

136
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:50,432
Oh, how we gonna find an Ursa Major when I can't even see my own hoof in front of my face?

137
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:51,533
Hold on.

138
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,732
Oh, heh. That's better.

139
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:20,152
Hey, guys, where ya goin'?

140
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:23,704
- Can't talk now.
- Got a major problem!

141
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:26,070
Yeah, Ursa Major, to be exact.

142
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:36,048
Trixie!

143
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,249
Twilight!

144
00:13:41,638 --> 00:13:45,045
Trixie!

145
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:50,047
Trixie thought she said the Great and Powerful Trixie did not want to be disturbed!

146
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:53,592
We-- We have a tiny problem.

147
00:13:53,593 --> 00:13:56,293
Actually, it's a big one.

148
00:13:56,294 --> 00:14:00,233
What is so important that you cannot wait until morning to disturb Trixie?

149
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:17,990
Twilight! You gotta come! Quick!

150
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,869
I already told you, Spike, I don't wanna show up Trixie!

151
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,113
No, you don't understand, it's--

152
00:14:25,137 --> 00:14:27,417
Uh, is that what I think it is?

153
00:14:27,418 --> 00:14:28,418
Majorly. 

154
00:14:29,177 --> 00:14:32,414
Great and Powerful Trixie, you've got to vanquish the ursa.

155
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:35,516
Yeah, vanquish so we can watch.

156
00:14:35,517 --> 00:14:38,303
It took a lot of trouble to get that thing here.

157
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:43,481
Wait, you brought this thing here? Are you out of your little pony minds?

158
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,779
But -- you're the Great and Powerful Trixie.

159
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,442
Yeah, remember? You defeated an Ursa Major.

160
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:55,764
Uh, okay. Stand back.

161
00:15:02,697 --> 00:15:04,537
Heh. Piece of cake.

162
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:09,240
Aw, come on, Trixie.

163
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,693
Stop goofin' around and vanquish it, eh?

164
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:24,408
Well, that was a dud.

165
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:30,345
Yeah, come on! Where's all the cool explosions and smoke and stuff like earlier? You know.

166
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:54,139
What's going on?

167
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,416
We brought an ursa to town.

168
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:57,817
You what!?

169
00:15:57,818 --> 00:16:01,727
Don't worry, the Great and Powerful Trixie will vanquish it.

170
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,890
I can't.

171
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:05,491
What!?!

172
00:16:05,492 --> 00:16:11,672
I can't, I never have. No one can vanquish an Ursa Major. I just made the whole story up to make me look better.

173
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:12,873
Made it up!?

174
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:01,498
Nice use of number sixteen.

175
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:25,051
That's new.

176
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,865
Unbelievable!

177
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:06,233
That was amazing!

178
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:10,609
Heavens to Betsy! We knew you had ability, but not that much!

179
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,761
I'm sorry. Please, please don't hate me.

180
00:18:13,762 --> 00:18:14,762
Hate you?

181
00:18:15,514 --> 00:18:17,893
Why, whatever do you mean, darling?

182
00:18:17,894 --> 00:18:23,102
Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie's showing off with her magic tricks, and I just thought--

183
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:28,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Magic's got nothing to do with it. Trixie's just a loudmouth.

184
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:29,621
Most unpleasant.

185
00:18:29,622 --> 00:18:31,422
All hat and no cattle.

186
00:18:31,523 --> 00:18:34,634
So -- you don't mind my magic tricks?

187
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:39,158
Your magic is a part of who you are, sugar cube, and we like who you are.

188
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,637
We're proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as our friend.

189
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:46,798
And after whuppin' that ursa's hind quarters, we're even prouder.

190
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,999
You are?

191
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:53,613
Wow, Twilight, how'd you know what to do with that Ursa Major?

192
00:18:53,614 --> 00:19:00,436
That's what I was doing when you came looking for me. I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was compelled to do a little reading up on them.

193
00:19:00,437 --> 00:19:04,001
So it is possible to vanquish an Ursa Major all by yourself?

194
00:19:04,002 --> 00:19:07,496
That wasn't an Ursa Major, that was a baby, an Ursa Minor.

195
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:08,897
That was just a baby?

196
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:13,521
And it wasn't rampaging, it was just cranky because someone woke it up.

197
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:21,148
Well, if that was an Ursa Minor, then what's an Ursa Major like?

198
00:19:27,492 --> 00:19:29,233
You don't wanna know.

199
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:38,816
Huh. You may have vanquished an Ursa Minor, but you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie!

200
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,704
Why that little...

201
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:47,513
Just let her go. Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson. 

202
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:51,240
Now, about you two.

203
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:54,753
Ah. Uh we're sorry that we woke up the Ursa Minor.

204
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:57,932
We just wanted to see some awesome magic.

205
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:02,650
Yeah! And the way you vanquished that Ursa Minor was awesome!

206
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:09,149
We deserve whatever punishment you give us.

207
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,078
For starters, you can clean up this mess. 

208
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:16,994
And... What do you think, Spike? Should I give them number twenty five?

209
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:22,256
Oh, twenty five! Yes! And I think I deserve it, too.

210
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:25,524
I think you're right.

211
00:20:31,873 --> 00:20:34,201
Sweet! 

212
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:37,257
Dear Princess Celestia,

213
00:20:37,258 --> 00:20:40,731
I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship:

214
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:45,425
I was so afraid of being thought of as a show off, that I was hiding a part of who I am. 

215
00:20:45,426 --> 00:20:49,275
My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents,

216
00:20:49,276 --> 00:20:52,126
and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off.

217
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,314
Especially when when you're standing up for your friends.

218
00:20:54,315 --> 00:20:59,097
So, you finally admit that you're the most talented unicorn in all of Ponyville?

219
00:20:59,098 --> 00:21:05,826
Well, yeah, but it's nothing to brag about. So, uh, how did it go with Rarity?

220
00:21:05,827 --> 00:21:08,786
Ah, she didn't go for the moustache.

221
00:21:08,787 --> 00:21:13,107
You know, Spike, that moustache has nothing to do with who you really are.

222
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:15,479
Maybe you should just try being yourself.

223
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,427
Or... Maybe the moustache wasn't enough. Maybe if I had a moustache and a beard!

224
00:21:21,428 --> 00:21:23,728
Uh, not this again!

225
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:29,624
Okay, imagine me with a nice, long, Fu Manchu type beard. Or maybe a goatee. Oh, no...
