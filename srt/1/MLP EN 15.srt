1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,550
Eyes over here, Spike!

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,420
Uh, sorry.

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,210
For this to work, it's crucial we keep our concentration totally on the...

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,520
Spike! This magic needs our full attention to make it happen. There's no other way!

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,070
I can't help it.

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,590
Look.

7
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,430
Nevermind her, she's just being Pinkie Pie.

8
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,890
Super-extra Pinkie Pie today.

9
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,510
Twitchy twitcha twitcha twitch.

10
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,520
Pinkie pie? What in the wide-wide-world of Equestria, are you up to?

11
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,560
It's my tail! It's my tail! It's a-twich a-twichin'!

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,560
And you know what that means!

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,560
Actually, Pinkie, I haven't the slightest idea.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,080
The twichin' means my Pinkie Sense is telling me that stuff's gonna start falling! You should better duck for cover.

15
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,270
Oh, Pinkie, it's not gonna rain. Why there's barely even a cloud in the- ugh!

16
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,830
He just said, "nice catch" in Frog.

17
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,070
Oh, I'm so, so sorry. You okay, Twilight Sparkle?

18
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:09,280
I just couldn't stand to see the pond getting so over-populated, what with the frogs all hopping into each other and all,

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,660
so I decided to fly as many as I can on over to Froggy Bottom Bog.

20
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,090
Of course you did.

21
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,090
Bye-bye!

22
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,760
Twilight? You gotta little somethin' on your face there.

23
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,340
Oh, really? Did your Pinkie Sense tell you that, too?

24
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,470
Nah! I could just see it.

25
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,980
C'mon, Spike, let's continue our practice session where there's a little less, commotion.

26
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,000
Wow! That was amazing! Pinkie Pie predicted that something would fall, and it did!

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,090
Oh, come on. She said that something would fall, and a frog just happened to fall at the same time.

28
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,470
A coincidense, nothing else to it.

29
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,870
My tail! My tail! Twitch-a-twitch! Twitch-a-twitch!

30
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,900
Somethin' else is gonna fall!

31
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,590
Pinkie, please. Nothing else is gonna FAAAA...

32
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,890
Oh, no, Twilight fell! Is it... safe to go help her?

33
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,500
It's okay, my tail stopped twitching.

34
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,700
That was amazing!

35
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,980
Please.

36
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,950
Uh, Twilight? Why are you hanging out in a ditch?

37
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,120
Because, Pinkie Pie predicted it!

38
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,360
Honestly, Spike, she did not. Two coincidents in a row like this may be unlikely,

39
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,370
but it's still easier to believe than twitchy tails that predict the future.

40
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,800
Twitchy tail? Pinkie Sense?

41
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,090
Don't worry, it's safe. Prediction already came true.

42
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,700
Oh, wait. Don't tell me you believe in this stuff, too?

43
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,440
I know it doesn't make much sense, but those of us who have been in Ponyville a while,

44
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,670
have learned over time that, if Pinkie's-a-twichin', you better listen.

45
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,290
My ears are flopping! My ears are flopping!

46
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,840
What does that mean?!

47
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,600
I'll start a bath for you.

48
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,000
A bath? This keeps on getting more ridiculous by the minute!

49
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,430
Sooo, basically, it works like this: I get different, little, niggly feelings and they mean different things.

50
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,750
Like when my back is itchy, it means it's my lucky day.

51
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,090
And, when my knee gets pinchy, that means something scary's about to happen.

52
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,160
Is your knee pinchy now?

53
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,690
No, but my shoulder's achy, that means there's an alligator in the tub.

54
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,740
How come your knee didn't get pinchy?! That isn't just scary, it's downright dangerous!

55
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,760
No it's not, silly! This is my pet alligator, Gummy, He's got no teeth. See?

56
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,170
Okay, okay... I get it.

57
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:50,230
Well, I still don't believe all this... "special power" stuff. It's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.

58
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,220
What's not to believe? You do magic, what's the difference?

59
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,860
Huge! For one thing...

60
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,870
...magic is something you study and practice.

61
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:09,100
It only happens when you decide to do it. It's meant to make something specific that you choose to happen, happen.

62
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,130
But you, uh, it makes no sense at all!

63
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,410
That's so not true, Twilight!

64
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,860
Sometimes it's a bunch of random things happening to my body at random times that supposedly predict the future.

65
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,810
I call 'em "combos".

66
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,040
Combos?

67
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,900
Sure! You know, like, ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter,

68
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,890
that means the sky is about to be graced by a beautiful rainbow!

69
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,190
Yeah, sure.

70
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,760
Combo coming on.

71
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,250
Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch!

72
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,150
You said that combo meant beautiful rainbow.

73
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,420
Oh no-no-no-no-no, you're thinking of an ear flop, then knee twitch, eye flutter.

74
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,240
This was an ear flop, then eye flutter, then knee twitch.

75
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,240
That usually means "look out for opening doors". You okay?

76
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,640
I don't believe this.

77
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,450
You don't believe because you don't understand.

78
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,790
Okay, now when you get another twitch, we'll have all kinds of scientific information.

79
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,790
Okey-dokey-lokey!

80
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,330
Any twitches yet?

81
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,330
Nopey-dopey!

82
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,730
Now? Anything?

83
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,180
Wait! Hold on!

84
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,430
Uhh, no.

85
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:48,640
Are you kidding me?! After a whole day of non-stop twitching, now that I've got you all hooked up, you're not getting a single one?

86
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,890
I don't control it, they just come and go.

87
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,280
That makes no sense!

88
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,300
Sometimes you just have to believe in things, even when you can't figure 'em out.

89
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,540
I will not believe in anything I cannot explain.

90
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,180
Wait, hold on, I'm feeling something...

91
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,740
Oh my gosh, what? What is it?!

92
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,900
It's my tummy! That usually means I'm hungry! Let's eat!

93
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,630
You know what?

94
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:20,470
Just forget it! I don't need to know if this is real or not, I don't need to understand it. I don't even care!

95
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,640
Okey-dokey-lokey.

96
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,550
Pinkie? Have you seen Twilight?

97
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,050
Twilight? What are ya doing back there?

98
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,080
Did you two plan this?

99
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,840
Plan what?

100
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:58,030
This is ridiculous. This can't be happening. This makes no sense. I have to figure this out.

101
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,740
Twilight?

102
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,470
Honestly, Spike, don't you know better to sneak up on ponies?

103
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:45,610
Sorry, but, um, well, isn't that what you're doing?

104
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,750
No! I'm doing scientific research.

105
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:57,150
I'm observing Pinkie Pie, scientific name: Pinkius Piecus, in its natural habitat.

106
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,370
Pinkius-whoicus?

107
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,380
There's something fishy going on with the whole twitchy prediction thing, and I'm getting to the bottom of it.

108
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,530
So, shh.

109
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,030
Come on, Pinkius Piecus is on the move.

110
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,950
Itchy nose...

111
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,520
That makes no sense.

112
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,490
See, she's hiding like something's about to fall out of the sky,

113
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,940
but a twichy tail means that somethings about to fall from the sky, not an itchy nose.

114
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,050
- This proves perhaps conclusively that...
- Gah!

115
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,280
Spike! Where are you going? I'm trying to teach you the value of scientific...

116
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,870
What's she doing now?

117
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,020
Smelling a flower.

118
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,180
Holy guacamole! I wonder what that means.

119
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,180
Probably that the flower smells good.

120
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,370
Wait. I'm getting something.

121
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,990
Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch.

122
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:14,040
Hold on... You told me that's the combo that says "watch out for opening doors"!

123
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,850
You really, really believe this stuff, don't you?

124
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,370
Here, let me show you there's nothing to be afraid of.

125
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,770
You see?

126
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,700
I promise you there's nothing to fear from that...

127
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,470
Twilight! You came to visit my new apple cellar, how nice.

128
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,320
Twi? You okay? Uh, Twi?

129
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,890
Here, let me help you.

130
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,490
Okay, take this down:

131
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,840
twitchy tail.

132
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,820
Twitchy tail? TWITCHY-TAIL!

133
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,920
Hush, Spike! We can't let Pinkie know we're here, remember?

134
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,640
Something's gonna fall, something's gonna fall! Run for your lives.

135
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,850
Spike honestly, you're overreact...

136
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,340
Hey, Applejack. Whatchya doin'?

137
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,620
Takin' more apples to my new apple cellar. How 'bout you Pinkie? Whatchu doin'?

138
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,940
Oh, letting Twilight secretly follow me all day, without me knowing.

139
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,830
You mean you knew all along?! Why didn't you tell me?

140
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,470
Silly, that would've spoiled the secret!

141
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,290
Tail... still twitching?

142
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,040
All done, clear skies from here on in, as far as I can tell.

143
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,860
Oh no! What does that one mean?

144
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,560
Dunno, never gotten any like it before.

145
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,520
But whatever that shudder's about, it's a doozie.

146
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,140
Something you never expect to happen is gonna happen!

147
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,930
And its gonna happen... At Froggy Bottom Bog!

148
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,510
That's where Fluttershy's headed!

149
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,530
Oh no! Is it about her?

150
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,640
Uh, I'm not sure.

151
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,960
We better go and make sure she's okay.

152
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:12,470
Calm down everypony. All we know right now is that Pinkie Pie just got a case of the shivers. That's all.

153
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,560
Hey! I thought you didn't believe in this stuff.

154
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:27,020
I don't. I just want to be there to see the look on Pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong.

155
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,020
Okey-dokey!

156
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,540
Cold? Need a jacket or something?

157
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,560
No thanks, I'm fine.

158
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,680
So... What do you think happened to Fluttershy?

159
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,940
I hope nothin'.

160
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,420
I know, but, what do you think happened?

161
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,320
I'm tryin' not to think about it.

162
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,660
Me too. But I'm thinkin' about it, anyway.

163
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,010
Like, what if, she exploded?

164
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,670
Just exploded? For no reason?

165
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,720
- Yeah, like. boom!
- Woah!

166
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,170
I know.

167
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:25,070
What if... What if she exploded, and then... and then exploded again!?

168
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,710
Can you do that? Can you explode twice?

169
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,160
Of course not.

170
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,180
But, what if, she exploded, and exploded again, and then... ugh!

171
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,960
Will you two stop? She's fine, I'm sure of it.

172
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,620
I hope your right, for Fluttershy's sake.

173
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,850
Look! There's Froggy Bottom Bog!

174
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,870
Fluttershy!

175
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,450
Fluttershy?

176
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,940
Fluttershy! You're okay!

177
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,890
Of course.

178
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,920
What a relief.

179
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,280
I'm so glad everything's alright.

180
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,470
Sorry, I know its not nice to gloat but...

181
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:16,000
AHA! I told you there was nothing to worry about and I was right.

182
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,050
Pinkie Pie said whatever she was shuddering about was a [couch] doozie,

183
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,470
and the only [cough] doozie here is how right I am.

184
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,040
Twilight?

185
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,570
Pinkie's made a lot of predictions today but [cough] ugh, what is that smell?

186
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:39,080
But what we've shown here is that there's no point in believing [cough] in anything you can't see for yourself.

187
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,600
W-well t-then s-see what's b-b-behind you, Twilight.

188
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,650
I see it... But I don't believe it!

189
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,360
Is that a hydra!?

190
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,030
Who cares? RUN!

191
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,590
Pinkie! Come on!

192
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,740
I'm so sorry.

193
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,190
- Everypony up that hill!
- He-e-elp!

194
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,410
Coming, Spike! Hang on!

195
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,830
I think we're gonna make it.

196
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,830
But Pinkie's still shuddering!

197
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,660
Oh, lookie there, it stopped.

198
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,600
Oh, there it is again.

199
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,610
He'll be up here in no time! Quick, one at a time, cross!

200
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,670
Do you know any spells for turnimg a hydra into a mouse?

201
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,390
No.

202
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,820
- How about a squirrel?
- No!

203
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,450
- How about...
- No small rodents of any kind!

204
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,700
That's too bad.

205
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,660
A hop, skip, and a... jump!

206
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:46,320
He's too close. I'll distract him. You two go, now!

207
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,420
What would a brave pony like Rainbow Dash do...?

208
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,520
CHAAARGE!

209
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,260
T-Twilight?

210
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,900
T-Twilight! You have to jump!

211
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,520
I'll never make it!

212
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,940
You'll be fine!

213
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,940
I will not!

214
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,280
It's your only ho-o-ope!

215
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,030
You have to take the leap of faith!

216
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,540
No!

217
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,800
Oh no! Noooo!

218
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,830
I knew you could do it, Twilight!

219
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,630
I don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what,

220
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:37,600
but you said there'd be a doozie here at Froggy Bottom Bog, and I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozie.

221
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
I mean that hydra...

222
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,900
Pinkie?

223
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,000
That wasn't it.

224
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,410
What wasn't what?

225
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,610
What are you talking about Pink?

226
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,400
The hydra wasn't the doozie.

227
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,030
I'm still getting the shudders.

228
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:03,030
You see? There it is again. Whatever the doozie was at Froggy Bottom Bog, my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened.

229
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:11,670
But I-WHAT!? The hydra wasn't the doozie?! How could it not be the doozie?! What could be doozier than that?

230
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,050
Dunno, but it just wasn't it.

231
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,140
I give up...

232
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,500
Give what up, Twi?

233
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,460
The fight. I can't fight it anymore.

234
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,650
I don't understand how, why, or what, but Pinkie Sense somehow... makes sense.

235
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,220
I don't see how it does, but it just does.

236
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,280
Just because I don't understand doesn't mean its not true.

237
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,770
Y-y-y-you m-m-mean you b-b-b-believe?

238
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,310
Yup, I guess I do.

239
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,870
That was it. That's the doozie.

240
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,630
What? What is?

241
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:08,250
You. Believing. I never expected that to happen. That was the doozie, oh and, oh what a doozie of a doozie it was!

242
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,590
Oh, good, Spike, you're here. Take a letter.

243
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,930
With pleasure, Twilight.

244
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,780
Dear Princess Celestia, I'm happy to report that...

245
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,100
Spike, what have I been saying about focus?

246
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,850
I know, but I... Well...

247
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,480
What's wrong Spike, never thought you'd see me with an umbrella hat on?

248
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,120
Not really, no.

249
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,950
Pinkie's tail's a-twitchin'. What else can I do?

250
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,940
I am happy to report that I now realize there are wonderful things in this world you just can't explain,

251
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:56,350
but that doesn't neccesarilly make them any less true. It just means you have to choose to believe in them.

252
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,770
And sometimes it takes a friend to show you the way.

253
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,930
- Honk!
- Honk...

254
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,300
Always, your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle

255
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,360
There it goes again.

256
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,290
I wonder what's gonna drop outta the sky this time.

257
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,290
You never know.

258
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,400
Twitchy tail?

259
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,190
Holy guacamole!
