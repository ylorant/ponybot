1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,500
Boy howdy! I got my work cut out for me. 

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,430
That there is the biggest bumper crop a' apples I ever laid eyes on.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,300
Ey-yup. Too big for you to handle on your own.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:20,630
Come on, big brother! You need to rest up and get yourself better. I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't handle. 

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,630
Oops, sorry. 

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,310
I'll take a bite out of this job by day's end.

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,400
Biting off more than you can chew is just what I'm afraid of.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,940
Are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep?

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,120
Yup.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:41,600
Why of all the... This is your sister Applejack, remember? The loyalest of friends and the most dependable of ponies?

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,660
But still only one pony, and one pony plus hundreds o' apple trees just doesn't add up to...

12
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,770
Don't you use your fancy mathematics to muddle the issue! 

13
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,750
I said I can handle this harvest and I'm gonna prove it to you. 

14
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:02,260
I'm gonna get every last apple out of those trees this applebuck season all by myself. 

15
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,020
Well I better get kickin'. These apples aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees. 

16
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,700
Hey!

17
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,700
 Oh no. 

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,980
STAMPEDE!

19
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:21,550
Hey...! Thiiis maaakes myyy voooice sooound siiilly!

20
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,690
Pinkie Pie, are you crazy?! Run!

21
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,410
Everypony calm down. There is no need to panic.

22
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,870
But Mayor, whatever shall we do?

23
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,870
Look there!

24
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,610
Move aside, Winona. 

25
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,410
Put 'em up, girl!

26
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,540
This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen.

27
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,540
Come on, little doggies! Herd! 

28
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,020
Winona, put 'em up! 

29
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,890
Gotcha. 

30
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,780
Attagirl. 

31
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,990
Now what was that all about?

32
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:41,970
Oh my! Begging your pardon, Applejack, but Mooriella here saw one of those nasty snakes.

33
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,900
And it just gave us all the willies, dontcha know.

34
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,690
I completely understand. Just next time, try and steer clear of Ponyville.

35
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,790
We certainly will, Applejack. So long, Winona!

36
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,800
Ride 'em, cowpony!

37
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,160
Applejack was just... just...

38
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,670
Appletastic!

39
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,930
Exactly. 

40
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,730
We must do something to thank Applejack for single-hoofedly saving the town.

41
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,620
I know. 

42
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,820
A party!

43
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,830
We all ready?

44
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,160
Just one last thing. 

45
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,100
Now we're ready.

46
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,790
Is Applejack all set?

47
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,820
Actually, I haven't seen her all week.

48
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,250
Not since the stampede.

49
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,000
But she'll be here for sure. Applejack is never late. 

50
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,240
Welcome everypony! 

51
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:00,840
Today we are here to honor a pony we can always count on to help in matters great and small. 

52
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,780
A pony whose contributions to...

53
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,310
Did you see Applejack's slick moves out there? What an athlete. 

54
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,670
This week she's gonna help me with my new flying trick, and I know it's gonna be so awesome.

55
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,940
Exactly. And...

56
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,180
This week, I get to run SugarCube Corner for the first time.

57
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,590
What does that have to do with Applejack?

58
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,960
Oh. Applejack, one of the best bakers ever, is gonna help me. 

59
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,740
Applejack makes everything great, so free samples for everypony!

60
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,640
Oh-kay, that's great. Now if I could just make a point without being inter...

61
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,450
Twilight?

62
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,400
...-rupted.

63
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:44,630
Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also helping me this week with the official bunny census, 

64
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,780
where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season. 

65
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,900
She's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills.

66
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,230
Anyone else? 

67
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,230
Anyone? 

68
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,230
No? 

69
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,030
Well then, as I was trying to say.

70
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,360
Nevermind.

71
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:14,820
And so, with no further ado, it is my privilege to give the prize, Pony of Ponyville Award, to our beloved guest of honor, 

72
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:22,440
a pony of the utmost trustworthiness, reliability, and integrity. Ponyville's most capable and dependable friend: 

73
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,440
Applejack!

74
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,190
Cool! Way to go Applejack, that was awesome! I mean, heh.

75
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,020
Awkward.

76
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,630
I'm here. 

77
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,630
I'm here. 

78
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,660
Sorry I'm late, whoa, I was just... 

79
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,660
Did I get your tail? 

80
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:56,400
Miss Mayor. Thank you kindly for this here... award thingy. 

81
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,330
It's so bright and shiny and...

82
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,770
and sure do look funny heh. 

83
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,230
Okay. 

84
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,270
Well, thank you Applejack for saving us from that scary stampede, 

85
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,190
and always being there for everypony.

86
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:25,440
Yeah. I like helping the ponyfolks and... and stuff. 

87
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,310
Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, tshanks.

88
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,880
Was it just me, or did Applejack seem a little...

89
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,280
- Tired?
- Dizzy?

90
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,910
Messy? 

91
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,220
Well, did you see her mane?

92
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,730
She seemed fine to me. 

93
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,190
What on Earth is that pony doing?

94
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,790
Hey Applejack!

95
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,820
Applejack!

96
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,050
Applejack!

97
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,450
Applejack!

98
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,640
Howdy Twilight.

99
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,110
What is all this?

100
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,110
It's Applebuck season. 

101
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,530
Applewhat season?

102
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:50,530
It's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time. We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em.

103
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,750
But why are you doing it all alone?

104
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,220
'cause Big Macintosh hurt himself.

105
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,450
What about all those relatives I've met when I first came to Ponyville? Can't they help?

106
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,490
They were just here for the Apple family reunion. 

107
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,950
They actually live all over Equestria and are busy harvestin' their own orchards. 

108
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,560
So, uh, I'm on my own. 

109
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,640
Which means, I should really get back to work. 

110
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,040
Hint hint? Get back to work?

111
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,440
Fine.

112
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,900
Could you step aside, Twilight?

113
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,010
I just did. 

114
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,210
Applejack, you don't look so good.

115
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,950
Don't any a' you three worry none, I'm just fine and dandy. 

116
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,350
Do you want some help?

117
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,890
Help? No way, no how.

118
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,130
But there's no way you can do it all on your own.

119
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,910
Is that a challenge?

120
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,650
Uhm... no?

121
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:54,840
Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it! Now if you'll excuse me, I've got apples to buck. 

122
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,260
There you are.

123
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,380
I'm a might' sorry, Rainbow. 

124
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:09,510
I was busy applebuckin' and I guess ah, I closed my eyes for a second and, when I woke up, I was late. 

125
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,460
Now, what's this new trick of yours?

126
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,460
See this contraption?

127
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,170
Yeah

128
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:19,060
Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then you're gonna jump down from that platform,

129
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,630
 launching me into the air faster than I can take off on my own. 

130
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:29,260
Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do some amazing flips and spins that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts.

131
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,390
Isn't that a might' dangerous?

132
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,310
Not for a pony who can fly.

133
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,310
Well, alrighty then. 

134
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,230
Oh my.

135
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,500
Ready? One... two... THREE! 

136
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,850
Maybe I wasn't clear. You're supposed to land on the other end.

137
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,610
Got it.

138
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:07,970
Applejack, what the hay is going on? I mean, I thought I was working with Ponyville's best athlete!

139
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:15,470
You are. I'm okay. Really. I have an idea. Watch this. 

140
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:26,070
Maybe not. Okay, one more try. I'm sure to get it this time.

141
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,540
Here I go!

142
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,080
Wait, Applejaaaaack!

143
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,390
You're welcome! 

144
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,580
Can I help you?

145
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,830
I think somepony else needs your help.

146
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,380
- Applejack?
- Yep.

147
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,980
Applejack, can we talk? 

148
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,760
Applejack, can we talk? 

149
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,680
CAN BEES SQUAWK?! I DON'T THINK SO.

150
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,510
No! Can we talk?

151
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,660
TWENTY STALKS? BEAN OR CELERY?

152
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,220
No! I need to talk to you.

153
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,440
YOU NEED TO WALK TO THE ZOO? WELL, WHO'S STOPPIN' YOU?

154
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,310
I need to talk to you!

155
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,970
OH! WELL WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO? WHAT YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT?

156
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,480
Rainbow Dash dropped in to see me today.

157
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,950
THAT'S QUITE NEIGHBORLY OF HER.

158
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,700
YES, EXCEPT THAT SHE CRASHED ONTO MY BALCONY AFTER YOU LAUNCHED HER INTO THE AIR.

159
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh, yeah. I wasn't feeling quite myself this morning.

160
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,910
Because you're working too hard and you need help.

161
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,260
WHAT? KELP? I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed.

162
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,600
HELP! YOU NEED HELP!

163
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:07,030
Nothin' doin', Twilight. I'm gonna prove to you, to everypony, that I can do this on my own. 

164
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,840
Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie.

165
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,550
Now Pinkie Pie, are you sure you're up for baking the muffins and running the store this afternoon?

166
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,350
Yes siree bob, Mrs Cake. Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out. 

167
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,390
Why, she's the best baker ever. Right, Applejack?

168
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,630
No? You're not the best baker ever?

169
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,800
WHAT? Oh no! 

170
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,470
I mean, don't you fret. I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye.

171
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,000
Alright. Wuh, see you later, girls!

172
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,550
Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'. 

173
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,370
Alrighty! I'll get the sugar and the eggs. Can you get me some chocolate chips?

174
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,410
Chat was that?

175
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:57,411
What was that?

176
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,210
Chocolate chips.

177
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,210
Chips... got it. 

178
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:07,080
Tater chips, all salty and dry, okie-dokie. 

179
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,810
What next?

180
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,630
Baking soda.

181
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:16,020
Soda. Perfect. That'll get the tater chips nice and wet. 

182
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,530
Now what?

183
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,370
A cup of flour.

184
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,390
A cup of sour? Well, lemons are sure sour. 

185
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,550
One cup of sour, comin' up. 

186
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,840
Anything else, Pinkie?

187
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,770
One last thing. Wheat germ.

188
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,560
Wheat worms? Oh, that must be fancy talk for earthworms.

189
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,250
Now that's gonna be delicious.

190
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,600
If you say so. 

191
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,700
Free muffin sample spectacular!

192
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,830
Yeah! Muffin spectacles! Get 'em while they're hot. 

193
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,770
We came as soon as we heard.

194
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,320
Oh thank you, Twilight. We need all the help we can get.

195
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,970
Oh no! What happened?

196
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,970
It was a mishap with some of the baked goods.

197
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:21,230
No, not baked goods, baked bads.

198
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,680
Applejack!

199
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,240
Want one?

200
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,710
What? Huh?

201
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,660
Applejack, we need to talk.

202
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:51,820
It's you, Twilight. I know what you're gonna say, but the answer is still no.

203
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,710
Not to upset your applecart, but you need help.

204
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,940
Hardy har. No I don't.

205
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,120
Here, let me help.

206
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,500
Help? No thanks. 

207
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,300
A little more... Little... 

208
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,040
There. 

209
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,650
I'll prove that this apple can handle these apples. 

210
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,660
Come on... apples... fall off.

211
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,870
AJ, think you're beating a dead... tree.

212
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,810
I knew that.

213
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,870
Actually Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about. I just came back from Ponyville Urgent Care and...

214
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,200
You know, I'm a little busy to get lectured right now, Twilight.

215
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
But if you'd just let me help...

216
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,680
No, no, NO! How many times do I gotta say it? 

217
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,070
I don't need no help from nopony!

218
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,610
That pony is stubborn as a mule.

219
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,430
No offense.

220
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,430
None taken. 

221
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:02,640
Oh Applejack! Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit round up. 

222
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,880
Why are we doin' this?

223
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,530
Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born, so it's my job to get a count of all the new families.

224
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,360
Fine. Can we just get on with it?

225
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,750
Certainly, but remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows. 

226
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,130
They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently.

227
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,950
I do NOT need any direction on corrallin' critters. Right, Winona?

228
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:31,110
Okay, little bunnies! I need you to all gathered here in the middle.

229
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:35,460
That's right! Let's go, bunnies. In the center. Hop to it.

230
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,830
 Swell. Just swell. 

231
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,260
Put 'em up, Winona!

232
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,520
Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them.

233
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,890
We know what we're doin'. Get along, little bunnies. 

234
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,460
Oh no. 

235
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,270
STAMPEDE!

236
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,130
The horror, the horror.

237
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,860
- It was awful.
- A disaster. A horrible, horrible disaster.

238
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,720
I don't get it.

239
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,670
Our gardens, destroyed.

240
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,550
Every last flower, devoured.

241
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,720
By... by... THEM!

242
00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:00,370
Oh my. Oh... Please stop, little bunnies. Oh no! Please, let's go home. Oh my goodness.

243
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,970
Alright. Enough is enough.

244
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:12,820
Must... keep... buckin'... just... a few... more. Must finish harvestin'.

245
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,570
Alright, Applejack. Your applebucking hasn't just caused you problems,

246
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,880
 it's over-propelled pegasus', practically poisoned plenty of ponies, 

247
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,200
and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies. 

248
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,400
I don't care what you say, you. Need. Help.

249
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,870
Ha! No I don't. Look, ah did it. 

250
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:39,040
I harvested the entire Sweet Apple Acres without your help. How d'ya like them apples?

251
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,840
Um, how do you like them apples?

252
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,630
Where'd all the apple...? 

253
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,210
Applejack? Applejack!

254
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,270
Oh, good, you're okay. 

255
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:02,740
Now Applejack, I completely respect the Apple family ways. 

256
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,190
You're always there to help any pony in need, 

257
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,740
so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside and allow your friends to help you?

258
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,620
- Okay, Twilight.
- I am not taking "no" for an answer... what?

259
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,730
Yes, Twilight. Yes. Please. I could really use your help.

260
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,800
Dear Princess Celestia, my friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have, 

261
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,240
and she's always there to help any pony. 

262
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,080
The only trouble is, when she needs help, she finds it hard to accept it.

263
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,860
So while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends, it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer.

264
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,570
Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle 

265
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:48,410
How about y'all take a little break? I got some fine apple juice waitin' for ya! 

266
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:54,200
Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help. I was acting a bit stubborn.

267
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,130
A bit?

268
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:00,040
Okay. A might' stubborn, and I'm awful sorry. 

269
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,710
Now, I know the town gave me the Prized Pony award.

270
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,880
But the real award is having you five as my friends.

271
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,820
That applebucking sure made me hungry.

272
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,820
And I've got the perfect treat.

273
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,710
Eeew... Spike, I threw those all away. Where'd you get them?

274
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,400
From the trash.

275
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,010
Just a little nibble? Come on.
