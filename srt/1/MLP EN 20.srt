1
00:00:04,377 --> 00:00:09,957
So sorry, Fluttershy. I hate being late for our weekly get-together. The usual!

2
00:00:11,898 --> 00:00:15,395
But you will not believe what happened to me.

3
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:16,696
Is everything all right?

4
00:00:16,697 --> 00:00:24,420
Oh, it's much more than all right. I was on my way here, wearing my latest hat creation, when who should stop me on the street?

5
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:28,353
- But Photo Finish!
- Photo finish?

6
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:33,501
She is the most famous fashion photographer in all of Equestria.

7
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:40,711
Anyhow, she saw my hat and said it was absolutely marvelous!

8
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:43,011
What a lovely compliment.

9
00:00:43,012 --> 00:00:48,486
She was so impressed that she wants to take some pictures of my shop featuring some of my clothes!

10
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:51,637
That's wonderful.

11
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:57,183
Do you know what this could mean for my fashion career?

12
00:00:57,184 --> 00:01:00,013
Oh, Rarity, I'm so happy for you.

13
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:03,449
But I'm going to need somepony fabulous to model for me. 

14
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:09,759
Somepony with beauty. Somepony with grace. Somepony... like you!

15
00:01:10,428 --> 00:01:12,545
Oh, goodness. I don't know.

16
00:01:12,546 --> 00:01:17,759
Oh, this is such a huge opportunity. And it would mean so much to me.

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,360
I'm flattered, really.

18
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:22,989
- Nopony is going to have your elegance and poise.
- But...

19
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:23,990
Nopony.

20
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:25,191
There has to be somepony more quali...

21
00:01:25,192 --> 00:01:26,092
Please!

22
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:27,293
Somepony more into fashion.

23
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:27,694
Please!

24
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:32,246
- Somepony more comfortable in the spotlight.
- Please, please, PLEEEASE!

25
00:01:34,363 --> 00:01:38,101
Oh, if it's that important to you, of course I'll do it.

26
00:01:38,102 --> 00:01:43,271
Oh, thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou! You are the best friend a pony could ever have!

27
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:48,478
What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.

28
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,685
Isn't it? Though I was so afraid you wouldn't agree to model for me that I felt completely frazzled. 

29
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:57,612
I think I feel a pimple coming on. Oh! Only one solution!

30
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,707
The usual! 

31
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:42,089
Hm... She's going to want to see attitude and pizzazz.

32
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,275
A-a-attitude and, um... pizzazz.

33
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:49,852
More light! It has to catch the sequins just so or the whole outfit is just a disaster.

34
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,838
Oh, and the headdress need more feathers. Pinkie Pie! More feathers! 

35
00:03:01,478 --> 00:03:03,735
And sequins! More sequins! 

36
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,754
And more ribbon! 

37
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,665
Oh no! Less ribbon.

38
00:03:14,942 --> 00:03:16,673
No! More ribbon. 

39
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:23,596
Oh, this hem is completely off. PINCUSHION! 

40
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:35,479
Thank you all for helping me. I'm sorry to be so short with you, but I'm... I'm just so nervous.

41
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,525
Oh, doesn't that hurt?

42
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:40,730
Thick scales. Can't feel a thing.

43
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:49,542
And even if I could, there is no pain that would keep me from assisting the most beautiful creature in the world. 

44
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,542
I'm gonna tell you two a secret. But you have to promise not to tell anyone.

45
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:58,925
- I promise.
- Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.

46
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:09,685
I have a crush on Rarity!

47
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:15,942
- We won't say a word!
- Give me a break. Everypony already knows how you...

48
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:22,971
Twilight! You promised Spike you wouldn't say anything. He trusts you. And losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend forever!

49
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:25,974
- But...
- FOREVER!

50
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:32,162
My lips are sealed. Though I'm pretty sure Rarity is gonna pick up on your feelings.

51
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,071
I, Photo Finish... have awwived.

52
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:43,214
Let me just say, what an honor!

53
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:48,567
We begin... NOW!

54
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:52,017
Attitude and pizzazz!

55
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:58,227
Yes! Show Photo Finish something. 

56
00:04:58,932 --> 00:04:59,845
No! 

57
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:02,701
Yeees. 

58
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:07,135
No! 

59
00:05:07,894 --> 00:05:09,161
Yeees. 

60
00:05:13,602 --> 00:05:14,821
No!

61
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:16,478
Yeees.

62
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:19,830
Enough!

63
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:27,814
She hardly took any pictures.

64
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:33,301
I'm so sorry. I tried my best.

65
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:36,792
Well, the headdress is too big for you and cape had too much sparkle.

66
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:39,734
 I can't believe I ever thought I could impress her.

67
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:44,665
It seems that I, Photo Finish, have found a next fashion star here in Ponyville.

68
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,666
Really?

69
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:54,083
Yes. Really. And I, Photo Finish, am going to help her to shine all over Eqvestria. 

70
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,762
Tomorrow a photo shoot in ze park. 

71
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:01,275
I go!

72
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:07,635
Did you hear that? I am going to "shine all over Equestria".

73
00:06:07,636 --> 00:06:10,927
Oh, Rarity. I was so worried I'd ruined everything.

74
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:14,076
Oh, never. I knew you'd be perfect. 

75
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:31,352
No, no, no, yes! 

76
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:39,703
That is definitely the one. Photo Finish is going to love it. Everypony is going to love it!

77
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:47,601
Oh, I am so excited for you. Just don't forget us little ponies when you become the most famous designer in all of Equestria.

78
00:06:47,602 --> 00:06:48,602
Never.

79
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:50,203
Put me down here. 

80
00:06:55,752 --> 00:07:04,803
Oh, nonononononono. The model should be in something simple! Something inspired by... the nature!

81
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:08,406
That's just what I was thinking.

82
00:07:10,118 --> 00:07:13,478
Um... give me a moment and I'll, uh, put a little something together.

83
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:15,736
Yes... that will not be necessary.

84
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:23,401
But... but... how are you going to help me "shine across Equestria" if I don't design something new for these pictures?

85
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:29,503
I am not going to help you shine across Equestria. I am going to help heeeer shiiiine.

86
00:07:29,504 --> 00:07:33,355
She is my star. You! Go! 

87
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:44,450
I can't, Rarity.

88
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:48,485
Oh, but you must, Fluttershy. Photo Finish wants to make you a star.

89
00:07:48,486 --> 00:07:56,609
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. I know we were both hoping it would be my lifetime, but nonetheless you can't throw away this chance. 

90
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,457
You must do this for me. You must. You must! YOU MUST!

91
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:06,244
Floottershy! It is time to make... the magics!

92
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:18,216
Oh, wunderbar! You are like a delicate flower. So much more alluring without all those sparkles und feathers. 

93
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,449
How'd it go? How'd it go?

94
00:08:26,937 --> 00:08:32,408
It didn't. Photo Finish wanted to work with Fluttershy, not me.

95
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:37,037
Oh, Rarity. I'm so sorry. Is there anything we can do?

96
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:40,761
I just vant to be alone right now.

97
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,362
You heard her. She vants to be... alone. 

98
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,082
What? I didn't think she meant alone alone. 

99
00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:05,356
Too much blush. 

100
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:08,176
Not enuf. 

101
00:09:09,777 --> 00:09:10,975
Too much.

102
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:12,940
 Not enuf. 

103
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:16,565
Perfect

104
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:25,515
Oh, yes! Even her schneezes are gressful.

105
00:09:25,516 --> 00:09:26,516
NOW GO! 

106
00:09:28,453 --> 00:09:33,038
How do you feel? Excited? Overjoyed? Frilled beyond your wildest dreams?

107
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,890
N... nervous.

108
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:41,660
Nervous? Dun be ridiculous. You're only facing a large crowd of ponies, who will be watching your every move and silently judging you.

109
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,386
Your cue! Now go!

110
00:09:54,821 --> 00:10:00,758
You can't let Rarity down. You must do this. You must. You must. You must.

111
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,588
- So graceful.
- So lovely.

112
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:15,288
So perfect for my new advertisement. 

113
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,227
It's Fluttershy!

114
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:28,545
Wow. Look how popular you are. I'm so excited for you. You must be having the best time ever.

115
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,785
Oh, yes. Best time ever...

116
00:11:33,578 --> 00:11:38,139
Flootershy! I have been looking for you everywhere. We have the thing at the place.

117
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,957
I'll see you at the spa. Our usual time?

118
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:46,630
Of course! I can't wait to hear all about the... "thing" at the place.

119
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:53,949
I'm the one who should be mobbed by strangers wherever I go.

120
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,734
Welcome to Carousel Boutique!

121
00:11:57,735 --> 00:12:00,896
Is she still here? We heard Fluttershy was here.

122
00:12:00,897 --> 00:12:07,776
Sorry. You just missed her. But you're still in luck. I'm having a huge sale of some of my best designs.

123
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:10,283
And you are...?

124
00:12:10,284 --> 00:12:11,975
Rarity, of course.

125
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:13,729
Never heard of you. 

126
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,943
Obviously I, Photo Finish, am fwilled to have found her.

127
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:25,944
Photo Finish?

128
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:30,625
- She's a natural in front of the camera.
- Um... Photo Finish?

129
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:34,898
I only need to point and shoot and I capture... the magics!

130
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:40,836
Photo Finish, I'm so sorry to interrupt. It's just that I'm running late.

131
00:12:41,284 --> 00:12:48,103
How could I have forgotten?! Your appearance at the ballet opening! Everypony who is anypony will be there.

132
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:51,992
- Oh, actually I'm supposed to be meeting my friend...
- WE GO! 

133
00:12:56,653 --> 00:13:00,731
My hooves are getting positively pruney, I've been waiting here so long. 

134
00:13:02,237 --> 00:13:07,297
Obviously Fluttershy's just too busy with her new career to spend time with her best friend.

135
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:09,623
I'm sure she just got tied up.

136
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:15,876
Of course she did. She's a big bright shining star! I wish that star would burn out.

137
00:13:15,877 --> 00:13:18,748
Rarity! Fluttershy is your friend.

138
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:24,037
I know, I know. And I should be happy for her, but instead I'm just... jealous!

139
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:29,835
Oh, please promise you won't tell her I feel this way. Please, please, pleasepleasePLEASE!

140
00:13:29,836 --> 00:13:34,084
You have my word. Losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend.

141
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:35,885
FOREVER!

142
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:43,539
Wow! You look great!

143
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,842
Fluttershy may be the one who's famous, but that doesn't mean I have to stop looking fabulous.

144
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:56,042
Rarity! I'm so sorry I'm... 

145
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:59,925
Oh no. She's already gone, isn't she?

146
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:01,226
Sorry.

147
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:07,077
Oh, I can't believe this. I am so frustrated I could just scream. 

148
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:13,684
Feel better?

149
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,190
No.

150
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:19,451
- Can I tell you something?
- Of course.

151
00:14:19,452 --> 00:14:21,682
You promise not to tell Rarity?

152
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:22,683
I swear.

153
00:14:22,684 --> 00:14:24,289
Pinkie Pie-swear?

154
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,955
Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my... AARGH!

155
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:42,214
I don't like being a model. No, I hate being a model. All this attention is awful, just awful. And I'm only doing it because Rarity told me I must. I must! I MUST! 

156
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:44,776
I must...

157
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:52,784
Oh, really? Well... If you wanna know the truth, Rarity...

158
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,276
- Oh, what were you about to say?
- Forever!

159
00:15:01,205 --> 00:15:02,549
Nothing! 

160
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:11,695
I was just thinking. If you really don't like being a model, you could always quit.

161
00:15:11,696 --> 00:15:16,599
Oh, no. I could never do such a thing. Rarity would be devastated.

162
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,900
But Rarity told me...

163
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:31,281
Mmm... Juicy! 

164
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:40,521
Oh, if only all these ponies didn't like me so much. Photo Finish wouldn't want me to model anymore. She'd find somepony else with...

165
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,722
the magic!

166
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:43,123
I guess you're right.

167
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:47,529
You're right. You're right, you're fight, you're right!

168
00:15:48,644 --> 00:15:50,274
It's Fluttershy! 

169
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:59,137
Don't you see? On her own, Fluttershy could never do something unattractive.

170
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:05,035
But if I used my magic to help her do something unattractive on her next fashion show, no one would ever want her to model again. 

171
00:16:05,036 --> 00:16:09,742
And if Fluttershy no longer has to be a model, Rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her.

172
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:12,008
And I'll no longer have to keep their secrets!

173
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:15,173
It's the perfect plan! You can't tell anyone about it. 

174
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,632
Promise me you won't tell anyone?

175
00:16:26,423 --> 00:16:29,398
So you do promise or you don't?

176
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:35,377
Uh, yes! Obviously, that's why I zipped my mouth closed, then locked it with a key, then dug a hole, 

177
00:16:35,378 --> 00:16:40,324
then buried the key, then built a house up top the hole where I buried the key, then moved into the house atop the hole.

178
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:42,582
Obviously. 

179
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:52,644
You really think it'll work?

180
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:58,427
They love you for being you. So all I have to do is make you not be you. Just leave it to me.

181
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:10,381
Guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about.

182
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:50,737
Oh no.

183
00:17:54,062 --> 00:17:55,957
Get her off the stage!

184
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,662
She's an embarrassment to all things fashion!

185
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:02,113
I, Photo Finish, have made a terrible mistake!

186
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,057
Bravo! I say bravo!

187
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:12,757
Bravo? Who could possibly say bravo to that horrid display?

188
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:18,451
Such attitude! Such pizzazz! She's invented an entirely new kind of modeling! Bravo!

189
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:20,452
Who is saying these things?

190
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:21,853
It's her.

191
00:18:21,854 --> 00:18:24,791
The unicorn in the gorgeous cape and headdress.

192
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:29,351
Now that is a pony, who clearly knows a thing or two about fashion. 

193
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:35,207
Well, if that fabulous pony likes it, then I do too! Bravo! 

194
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:56,371
This is awful. Just awful! Somehow I've become more popular than ever. Oh, I'm so frustrated I could just kick something!

195
00:18:59,177 --> 00:19:02,908
If only Rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly.

196
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,347
But Rarity...!

197
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:08,675
Fluttershy! Are you all right?

198
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:15,137
I'm great! I'm a super famous fashion model. Why wouldn't I be great?

199
00:19:15,138 --> 00:19:16,138
Because you ha...! 

200
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:21,376
Out there on the runway, everyone was turning on you and... Oh

201
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:26,403
Oh, Fluttershy. It's so awful. I wanted them to.

202
00:19:26,404 --> 00:19:27,404
You did?!

203
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:29,747
Of course she did! Because...! 

204
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:35,963
I'm jealous! I wanted all the attention. And instead it was going to you.

205
00:19:35,964 --> 00:19:40,192
I even started hoping that you would do something silly so your modeling career would be over. 

206
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:47,897
But then, when it started happening, all I could think was how could I want you to fail at something you love so much?

207
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:50,530
But... Fluttershy doesn't... Ugh! 

208
00:19:52,504 --> 00:19:56,296
Love? Oh, Rarity. I hate being a model.

209
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:58,638
- You do?
- More than anything.

210
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:00,646
Then why did you keep doing it?

211
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:06,640
I was afraid if I quit, you'd me mad at me for not wanting to... "shine all over Equestria".

212
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:10,931
And I thought if I told you how jealous I was of your success, you'd think I was a terrible friend.

213
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:11,932
Never!

214
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:13,433
All this time!

215
00:20:13,434 --> 00:20:15,908
If we just told each other the truth.

216
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:18,999
I promise never to keep my feelings in secret again.

217
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,700
Me too.

218
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:23,758
Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.

219
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:31,318
You were brilliant. Brilliant! I've already got six photo shoots lined up for tomorrow aloon.

220
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:35,994
I'm sorry, Photo Finish, but I don't think I'll be able to make any of them.

221
00:20:35,995 --> 00:20:36,995
Wat?

222
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:38,739
We go!

223
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:44,253
Vat has just happened?

224
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,642
Spike has a crush on Rarity! 

225
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:51,297
And you were doing so well. 

226
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:55,693
Now this is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.

227
00:20:55,694 --> 00:20:57,094
Isn't it, though?

228
00:20:57,095 --> 00:21:02,178
Dear Princess Celestia. Being a good friend means being able to keep a secret. 

229
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:06,145
But you should never be afraid to share your true feelings with a good friend.

230
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:08,062
Did you get all that, Spike?

231
00:21:08,063 --> 00:21:13,823
No. I did not. I still can't believe you told someone about my secret feelings for Rarity.

232
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:18,234
You're right. That was wrong of me and I'm very sorry.

233
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:20,266
Apology accepted.

234
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:23,239
Now will you take down my letter to Princess Celestia?

235
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,756
I would love to. But... I'm a little busy at the moment.
