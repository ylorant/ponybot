1
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,990
Let's quiet down please. We have a very important lesson to get to.

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,490
Thank you. Today we are going to be talking about cutie marks.

3
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,380
Boring.

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,250
You can all see my cutie mark, can't you?

5
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:33,790
Like all ponies, l wasn't born with a cutie mark. My flank was blank.

6
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,490
She's so precious!

7
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:43,150
Then one day, when l was about your age, l woke up to find that a cutie mark had appeared.

8
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,480
Look at her hair!

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,790
Yes l know, but honestly, that's how everypony was wearing their mane back then.

10
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:58,360
l had decided to become a teacher, and the flowers symbolized my hope that l could help my future students bloom

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,650
if l nurture them with knowledge.

12
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,440
The smiles represented the cheer l hope to bring to my little ponies while they were learning.

13
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,310
Now, can anyone tell me when a pony gets his or her cutie mark?

14
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,310
When she discovers that certain something that makes her special!

15
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,290
That's right, Twist.

16
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:24,800
A cutie mark appears on a pony's flank when he or she finds that certain something that makes them different from every other pony.

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,730
Discovering what makes you unique isn't something that happens overnight,

18
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:34,490
and no amount of hoping, wishing, or begging, would make a cutie mark appear before its time.

19
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,900
What!

20
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,300
Apple Bloom! Are you passing a note?

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,220
What could be so important that it couldn't wait until after class?

22
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,220
It's blank.

23
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,650
Remind you of anypony?

24
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,430
Want some sweets? I've got some peppermint sticks. I made them myself.

25
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,540
They'll make you smi-i-le.

26
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,050
No...

27
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,420
I don't know why we had to sit through a lecture about getting a cutie mark.

28
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:13,040
I mean, waiting for your cutie mark is sooo last week. You got yours, I just got mine. We all have them already.

29
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,870
I mean, almost all of us have them already.

30
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,470
Don't worry you two, you're still totally invited to my cute-ceanera this weekend.

31
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,750
It's going to be amazing.

32
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,380
It's a party celebrating me and my fantastic cutie mark. How could it not be?

33
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,110
Bump! Bump! Sugar-lump, rump!

34
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,400
Gimme a break.

35
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,750
See you this weekend.

36
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,220
Blank flanks!

37
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,920
It's not fair! It's just not fair!

38
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,830
Don't get your mane in a tangle. You'll get your cutie mark. Every pony gets one eventually.

39
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,290
But I don't want one eventually!

40
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,790
I want one right now! I can't go to Diamond Tiara's cute-ceanera without one, I just can't!

41
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:11,140
'course you can. Y'know, I was the last pony in my class to get my cutie mark, and I couldn't be prouder of it.

42
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,100
I know my future was to run Sweet Apple Acres, and these bright shiny apples sealed the deal.

43
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:22,920
Come to think of it, Granny Smith was the last one in her class, too. Huh, same as Big Macintosh.

44
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:31,040
I really don't see how that's supposed to make me feel better. It probably means that being the last one in your class to get a cutie mark runs in the family.

45
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,630
...runs in the family. Runs in the family!

46
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,500
Runs in the family!

47
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:42,940
You've got apples for your cutie mark, Granny Smith has an apple pie, Big Macintosh has an apple half,

48
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,780
my unique talent must has som'n to do with apples!

49
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,890
Apples apples apples!

50
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,090
Apples.

51
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,520
Get your delicious nutritious apples here!

52
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,410
Delicious and nutritious, and so many uses!

53
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,680
You can eat 'em, play with 'em...

54
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,010
Hey, watch it!

55
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,570
...create fine art for your home with 'em.

56
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,400
You have to be crazy not to get a bushel of your very own.

57
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,910
She's so creative.

58
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,370
You sir, care t' buy some apples?

59
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,900
No thanks.

60
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,990
- Why not?
- I have plenty at home.

61
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,040
- Are you sure?
- Yes I'm pretty sure I...

62
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,500
You're pretty sure, but you're not absolutely positively completely super-duper sure, are you?

63
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,810
If I buy some apples, will you please leave me alone?

64
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,510
Aaal-right!

65
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,680
You forgot your change!

66
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,380
That's how you sell s'm apples and get a cutie mark!

67
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,770
So, what does my cutie mark look like? A shopp'n bag full of apples? A satisfied customer eating an apple?

68
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,270
Maybe I gotta increase my sales figures first.

69
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,620
YOU TOUCH IT, YOU BUY IT. We take cash or credit.

70
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,520
I'm sorry ma'am.

71
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
Ma'am!

72
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,530
Apple Bloom, you can't just...

73
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,880
That'll be four bits.

74
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,860
I didn't put those in my bag.

75
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,420
Likely story. Four bits, lady!

76
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,010
Apple Bloom! I am really really sorry about that. She's new.

77
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,560
Here, take these. No charge.

78
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,050
...and these.

79
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,740
...and these.

80
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,050
Y'all come back now, y'hear?

81
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,080
What?

82
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,510
Sorry little sis, but your apple-sellin' days are over.

83
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,100
What? But how else am I gonna get my cutie mark?

84
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,210
Home. Now.

85
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,800
Listen sugar-cube, I know it's hard to wait for your very own cutie mark, but, you just can't force it.

86
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,330
Besides, you're not that grown-up just yet. Ain't there other fillies in your class without one?

87
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,470
Well... Twist doesn't have hers yet.

88
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,330
Do you think you'd feel better if you went to the party with her?

89
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,580
Well there you go. Bet you and Twist would have a great time together.

90
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,650
Now run along and find your friend.

91
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,310
You're sure you don't want me to stick around 'till the end of the market?

92
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,270
Hey! Who's been using my racket?

93
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,820
Yeah. I'm sure.

94
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,750
What's up Apple Bloom?

95
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,790
So I was thinkin'... maybe we could go to Diamond Tiara's cute-ceanera together.

96
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,050
I don't have a cutie mark, you don't have a cutie mark.

97
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,050
Well, um...

98
00:07:52,760 --> 00:08:02,030
Isn't my cutie mark swell? I've always loved making my own favorite sweets, but it took me some time to discover that it was my super-special talent.

99
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,530
Pretty sweet, huh?

100
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,430
Yeah, pretty... sweet.

101
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:16,060
Hey... this doesn't mean we can't go to the cute-ceanera together. You're still gonna come to the party, are you?

102
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:24,880
- Of course she will.
- It's not like being the only pony there without a cutie mark, would be, like, the most embarassing thing ever.

103
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,630
Looks like some pony's got a dark cloud hanging over her head.

104
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,700
Let me do something about that.

105
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,560
What's the matter, kid?

106
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,910
There's a cute-ceanera this afternoon and everypony in my class will be there and they'll all have their cutie marks and I wanna get my cutie mark

107
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,340
but I'm no good at sellin' apples but I really wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark

108
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,810
which my big sister says I'm gonna get eventually but... I WANT IT NOW!

109
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,020
Cutie mark? I can get you a cutie mark like that!

110
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,860
Applejack says these things take time. I have to just wait for it to happen.

111
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,640
Why wait for something to happen when you can make it happen?

112
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,450
But Applejack says th...

113
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:20,570
Hey, who are you gonna listen to, Applejack, or the pony who was first in her class to get a cutie mark?

114
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,090
I always liked flying an' all, but I was going nowhere in a hurry.

115
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:29,660
It wasn't until my very first race that I discovered a serious need for speed, and KAZAAM,

116
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,770
this sweet baby appeared as fast as lightning.

117
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,180
That's right, stretch out those legs. Gotta be nice and loose.

118
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:48,420
The key here is to try as many things as possible as quickly as possible. One of them is bound to lead to your cutie mark.

119
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,620
Are you ready?

120
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,800
I'm ready!

121
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,580
I said: Are! You! Ready!

122
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,030
I'M READY!

123
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,030
Juggling, go!

124
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,490
Hang-gliding, go!

125
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,320
Karate, go!

126
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,640
Kite-flying, go!

127
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,000
Ultrapony Roller Derby, go!

128
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,670
Tried that one... tried that one... tried that one...

129
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,910
Your new outfit is, like, perfect for the party.

130
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,130
I know. It totally shows off my cutie mark.

131
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,730
I love being special.

132
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,910
Can you imagine how embarrassing it must be to be... not special?

133
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,220
I don't even want to, like, think about it.

134
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,270
Tried that one... tried that one...

135
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:30,110
I'm doomed. Doomed! I'll never find something I'm good at.

136
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,160
You look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes.

137
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,960
Eatin' cupcakes?

138
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,880
Eatin' cupcakes?

139
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
Eatin' cupcakes!

140
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,540
I really appreciate all your help Rainbow Dash.

141
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,540
You're a really great coach and I really learned a lot from you and I'm sure I can learn a lot more but...

142
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,040
I've got some cupcakes to eat!

143
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,280
See you at cute-ceanera!

144
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,050
Hold on Pinkie Pie, I'm comin'.

145
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:02,060
I can't believe I didn't think of this. A cupcake-eating cutie mark, it's sooo obvious.

146
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,450
Now, where are those cupcakes? I'm ready t' chow down!

147
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,160
I don't have any cupcakes.

148
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,850
But you look like you'd be good at helping me make some.

149
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,500
I guess, uh, making-cupcakes cutie mark could work too.

150
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,188
All you have to do is take a cup of flour, add it to the mix

151
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:25,446
Now just take a little something sweet, not sour, a bit of salt, just a pinch

152
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,324
Baking these treats is such a cinch, add a teaspoon of vanilla

153
00:12:29,325 --> 00:12:33,372
Add a little more, and you count to four, and you never get your fill-a!

154
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,990
Cupcakes – so sweet and tasty
Cupcakes – don't be too hasty

155
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,630
Cupcakes – cupcakes, cupcakes, CUPCAKES!

156
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,560
Hot, hot, hot!

157
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,520
Those look much better than the last batch.

158
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,740
I guess I'm not cut out to be a baker either.

159
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,220
I just have to face it, I'm gonna have a blank flank forever.

160
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,220
What about that?

161
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,660
What about what? Is there something on my flank? Is there, is there, is there?

162
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:29,310
A cutie mark! It's a... a measuring cup? No. A mixin' bowl? No... Are those cupcakes?

163
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,310
A tower of cupcakes maybe.

164
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,640
Flour. It's flour!

165
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,120
Yay! I guessed it. What game you wanna play next? Please say bingo, please say bingo.

166
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,320
Whoa, what's been going on in here?

167
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,940
We've been making cupcakes, wanna try them?

168
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,210
No thank you... not that they don't look...

169
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,520
delicious.

170
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,850
Twilight, you have to help me.

171
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,850
What's the matter?

172
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,250
Tiara's cute-ceanera's today and everypony in my class will be there and they all have cutie marks and I want to get my cutie mark

173
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,450
but I'm no good at selling apples or hang-gliding or making cupcakes, but I wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party

174
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,250
if I don't have my cutie mark, which Pinkie Pie says I can't just make appear,

175
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,710
but I need it to appear, RIIIGHT NOW!

176
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,480
Aaah I don't follow. How can I help?

177
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,420
You can use your magic to make my cutie mark appear.

178
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,830
Oh no Apple Bloom. A cutie mark is something a pony has to discover for herself.

179
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,370
Please Twilight, just try.

180
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,170
I'm sorry but-

181
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,420
Oh please, please, please please please!

182
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,410
Alright alright!

183
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,560
Oh thank you thank you thank you.

184
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,680
Yes! I knew you could do... it.

185
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,650
I'm sorry sweetie, but I told you-

186
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,900
Try again, try again!

187
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:03,460
Told you that not even magic can make a cutie mark appear before its time.

188
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,230
It's hopeless, hopeless!

189
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:14,020
I just won't go to the party, I can't go. Everyone will just laugh at me and make fun of me and call me name.

190
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,180
It will be the worst night of my life.

191
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,850
I'm sure it won't be as bad as all that.

192
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,180
Forget it, there's no way I'm going to that...

193
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,210
... party.

194
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,470
How could I have forgotten the time? How could I have forgotten Pinkie Pie was hosting the party?

195
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,470
How could I have forgotten it was at Sugar Cube corner?

196
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,450
Don't forget your party hat, Forgetty Forgetterson!

197
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,430
I have to get out of here before anypony sees me.

198
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,430
It's my cute-ceanera, I'm supposed to get the first bite at cake.

199
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,070
Okay Apple Bloom, almost there.

200
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,690
Apple Bloom, you made it. After I heard about Twist, I was afraid you wouldn't show up.

201
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:57,040
I sure am glad you came to your senses about this whole cutie mark thing. These things happen when these things are supposed to happen.

202
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,970
Trying to rush 'em just drives you crazy. I'll let you be, looks like your friends want to talk to you.

203
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,020
Well well well, look who's here.

204
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,020
Nice outfit.

205
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,030
Just something I, uh, pulled together last minute.

206
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:24,470
It really shows off your cutie mark--oh wait, that's right, you don't have one.

207
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,180
I have a cutie mark.

208
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,800
What? Since when?

209
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,820
Since... Um... Earlier today.

210
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,670
Oh really? Let's see it.

211
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:42,210
I shouldn't, I couldn't. My cutie mark is so unbelievably amazing, I'm afraid that if I show it off,

212
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:48,790
everyone will start paying attention to me instead of you. Outshined at your own cute-ceanera,

213
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,900
can you imagine how embarrassing that would be?

214
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,180
Uh, forget it, I didn't really want to see it anyway.

215
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,370
Okay, well, Imma go mingle. Enjoy your party.

216
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,930
Oh no.

217
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,840
Wow, that is an amazing cutie mark.

218
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,440
Nice try, blank flank!

219
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,630
You got a problem with blank flanks?

220
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,490
I said, you got a problem with blank flanks?

221
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,000
The problem is, I mean, she's like, totally not special.

222
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,990
No, it means she's full of potential.

223
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:44,030
It means she could be great at anything. The possibilities are, like, endless.

224
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:49,350
She could be a great scientist, or an amazing artist, or a famous writer,

225
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,820
she could even be mayor of Ponyville some day.

226
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,930
...and she's not stuck being stuck-up like you two.

227
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,380
Hey, this is my party, why are you two on her side?

228
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,380
Because...

229
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,300
You don't have cutie marks either? I thought I was the only one.

230
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,610
We thought we were the only two.

231
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,360
I for one think you are three very lucky fillies.

232
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,680
Lucky? How can they be lucky?

233
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,090
They still get to experience the thrill of discovering who they are, and what they're meant to be.

234
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:28,700
And they got all the time in the world to figure it out, not just an afternoon.

235
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,106
- Wow, Apple Bloom!
- Do you really think you could be mayor?
- I wish I could be a scientist.

236
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,860
Maybe I got my cutie mark too soon.

237
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:43,640
Hey, what's everypony doing? This is my party, everypony is supposed to be paying attention to me.

238
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,840
Whatever. We still think you're losers, right Diamond Tiara?

239
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,860
Bump, bump, sugar... lump...

240
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,860
Not now, Silver Spoon.

241
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,550
Name's Scootaloo.

242
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,090
Sweetie Belle.

243
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,090
Apple Bloom.

244
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,560
It's all so super!

245
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:15,210
So I was thinking, now that we're friends... I mean, we are friends, right?

246
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:22,210
How could we not be? We're totally alike. We don't have cutie marks, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon drive us crazy.

247
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,040
Totally crazy.

248
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:32,180
Now that we're friends, what if the three of us work together to find out who we are and what we're supposed to be?

249
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,990
We could form our own secret society.

250
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,330
I'm liking this idea.

251
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:42,970
A secret society. Yeah. We need a name for it though.

252
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,020
The Cutie Mark Three?

253
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,010
The Cutastically Fantastics?

254
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,980
How about... The Cutie Mark Crusaders?

255
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,810
It's perfect!

256
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,670
- This is gonna be so great!
- We're gonna be unstoppable!

257
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,120
What do you say we celebrate with some of these delicious cupcakes?

258
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,320
NOT the cupcakes. Trust me.

259
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,420
Let's see if there are any cookies.

260
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah! Come on.

261
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:15,050
Dearest Princess Celestia, I am happy to report that one of your youngest subjects has learned a valuable lesson about friendship.

262
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:19,700
Sometimes, the thing you think will cause you to lose friends and feel left out...

263
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:26,470
...can actually be the thing that helps you make your closest friends and realize how special you are.
