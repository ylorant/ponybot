1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,090
This meteor shower tonight's gonna be amazing!

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,740
Awesome!

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,620
You know, this shower only happens once every 100 years.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,620
A centennial celebration!

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,540
We better get a move on!

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,540
Don't wanna be late!

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,080
There.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,560
Spike, did you grab my quill and ink?

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,490
Check!

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,620
Scrolls?

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,800
Check! 

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,410
I've also packed a telescope, apples, bananas, fruit punch and...

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,770
 my freshly baked home-made triple-decker nut-crazy vanilla cream cookies!

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,510
I can see that.

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,720
 Once again you've read my mind, Spike. 

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,300
And that is why you are my number one assistant.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,920
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,710
That is mhy you are my number one assistant.

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,630
Missed that! Huh...?

20
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,630
I said...! 

21
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,710
Come on, let's get going. 

22
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,540
Wait! I almost forgot. 

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,320
I wanna bring the "Astronomical Astronomer's Almanac to All Things Astronomy".

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,790
The Astronomo-lomo homono what?

25
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,730
You know that really old big blue book on stars, moons, planets, the Universe...?

26
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,730
Right. Check!

27
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,520
Hey! What's taking my number one assistant so long? 

28
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,940
I was sure I put the astronomer's guide back. 

29
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,300
The book would have helped me identify different planets and stars tonight.

30
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,620
Well... Maybe someone borrowed it? 

31
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,140
Besides, you don't need that book. 

32
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,530
You can already name all the planets and stars, 

33
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,350
cause you're super smart and astronomically awesome!

34
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,890
Thanks, Spike. You're such a flatterer.

35
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,580
Yeah, I'm a sweet talker.

36
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,380
And a number one assistant, right?

37
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,960
Check!

38
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,270
Wow, Twilight! You're lucky to have such a rad assistant. 

39
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,810
I wish I had someone to do whatever I told them.

40
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,170
Me! Me! Me! I'll do whatever you want, Rainbow Dash!

41
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,190
Oh yeah, pipsqueak? How about taking out the trash?

42
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,030
Yes ma’am!

43
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,720
Do we have Spike to thank again for this amazing spread? 

44
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Isn't he simply amazing?

45
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,380
Oh, come on. 

46
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,060
I said come on.

47
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:31,270
Little Spikey-wikey! Who knew that big ferocious dragon started off so cutesy wootsy?

48
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,270
Spike, you are such a little star that I had to make a little bow tie for you.

49
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,160
Gosh. You guys are embarrassing me. Stop it. 

50
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,310
Twilight, your turn.

51
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,000
Spike, that's enough.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,670
All right. That's enough.

53
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,160
Hey, everypony! The show is starting!

54
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,230
Wow! These cookies are deeleesh!

55
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,890
Spike made them. Speaking of, Spike, can you bring us some punch? 

56
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,930
Spike?

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,400
Ooh, poor little thing.

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,230
Oow. He's worked himself to the bone.

59
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,730
And now the punch has been... spiked! 

60
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,000
Goodnight, Spike. 

61
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,440
Sweet dreams, number one assistant.

62
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,340
The Study of Comets. 

63
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:19,990
Comets are small, irregularly shaped bodies that are made of non-volatile grains and frozen gasses. They...

64
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,160
...have body structures that are fragile and diverse...

65
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,580
Shoot! 

66
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,180
This is a job for Spike. If only he were awake...

67
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,910
Wait! Don't go! Don't be afraid. 

68
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,520
Thank you for returning my scroll.

69
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,840
Gosh, it's cold tonight. 

70
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,860
Say, would you like to relax in here and keep me company while I work?

71
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,490
Now, where was I? 

72
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:29,860
Oh, yes. "...fragile and diverse with a surrounding cloud of material called a coma, that grows in size and brightness as the comet approaches the sun..." 

73
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,810
I overslept! 

74
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,950
I know it's already ten, but I'm scaly-tailed and bright-eyed and ready to work twice as fast. 

75
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,150
Oh please, don't be upset, Twilight. And what do you want for breakfast? 

76
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,350
Oatmeal? How about a sunflower smoothie? Grass pancakes?

77
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,070
Spike, don't worry.

78
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,980
But my morning chores...

79
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,480
It's okay. Owlowscious did them for you.

80
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,350
Who?

81
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,350
He's our new junior assistant. 

82
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,100
He's gonna help out with your chores so you won't be so tired all the time.

83
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,150
Wha... Wh... What do we need a junior assistant for? 

84
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,750
I'm not tired. I do fine on my own. I don't need sleep, I...

85
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,510
Spike, don't worry. He's just here to help out a little. 

86
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:14,520
Now, I have to go out, so why don't you introduce yourself to Owlowscious? He's in the library.

87
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,350
Worried? Do I look worried? I'm not worried. Who's worried? 

88
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,260
Hello? 

89
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,470
Hello! 

90
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,950
Dude, that's creepy. 

91
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,730
Hi there! I'm Spike. I'm sure Twilight has told you all about me...

92
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:36,786
Hoo.

93
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,380
Spike? You know, assistant number one?

94
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,780
I'm Spike! And who are you? What are you?

95
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,780
Hoo!

96
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,520
I thought your name was Owlowscious!

97
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,030
Okay, "Who", "Owlowscious", whatever. I'm Spike, okay? 

98
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,570
Look! All you need to know is that I'm number one and you're number two. Got it?

99
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,420
So, a man of mystery, huh? 

100
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,210
I'm keeping my eye on you! 

101
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,200
I've got eyes in the back of my head too, you know? 

102
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,170
Well, not really, but... You know what I mean!

103
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,020
That bird is out for my job. He wants to be number one.

104
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,650
 I'll prove to Twilight that I deserve to be number one. Not Freaky Feathers over there.

105
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,490
 I won't let him have my job if it's the last thing I do! 

106
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:41,250
Oh, what a fantastical, fluffelicious feathery little friend! I'm... HOOked!

107
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,550
He's just wonderful.

108
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,050
"He's just wonderful."

109
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,070
 Uh, yes. Wonderful. He's quite... the charmer.

110
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,600
And Owlowscious is just such a star I just had to make this little bow for you.

111
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,720
What's he all saddle sore about?

112
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,660
He's probably just jealous of Owlowscious.

113
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,840
Maybe Spike feels threatened or worried that Owlowscious will replace him?

114
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,020
Replace him? Hah! That's crazy! Spike knows he can't be replaced. 

115
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,940
They're trying to replace me! 

116
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,220
I better step it up and make sure that Twilight and Owlowscious know that I'm still number one...

117
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,460
Hey, Spike! Can you fetch me that book called "Two-headed Myth...

118
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,840
...Mythological Mysteries!" I know where it is.

119
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,810
Thanks, Owlowscious. 

120
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,830
Hey, Spike, no worries. Owlowscious flew up and got the book for me. 

121
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,750
Oh, and gee! I guess I need "Ferrets of Fairyland too".

122
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,580
Hey!

123
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,070
Climb down from there before you fall. 

124
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,820
- Shoot!
- Yes, sir!

125
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,280
My last writing quill. It's broken.

126
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,760
Never fear, Spike, your number one assistant, is here.

127
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,260
Quill... quill... Where is it? Not here... 

128
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,140
Quill... 

129
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,810
Quill, where is it...?

130
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,290
Where am I gonna get a quill?

131
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,310
Spike, wait! Wait! 

132
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,510
But the store is called "Quills and Sofas". You only sell two things!

133
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,320
Sorry, Junior. All outta quills until Monday. 

134
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,930
Need a sofa? 

135
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,370
I swore I had one here somewhere. 

136
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,780
Ah, here it is! A quince!

137
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,810
Not a quince. A quill!

138
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,220
Right. A quail? 

139
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,200
A quilt! 

140
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,560
A quesadilla? 

141
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,960
A quiche!

142
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,560
Not a quiche. A quill!

143
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,420
Nope. Sorry. All outta quills

144
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,420
Shoot. 

145
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:20,790
Come on, chicken! Here, chicky chicky chicky! Here, chick chick chick chicky! Come here! Ugh! 

146
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,600
Come here! 

147
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,890
Spike... to the rescue.

148
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,550
Oh, Spike. I was calling out for you when you were turning this place upside down. 

149
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,600
Owlowscious gave me one of his feathers to use as a quill.

150
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,820
That's just great. Perfect! Sweet! 

151
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:04,220
I think I'll just, uh... finish up the rest of my chores! Or did Owlowscious already do them?

152
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,010
Oh, no no. There are quite a lot of them.

153
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,800
Well, that's fine. Because I can just stay up all night and finish...

154
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,830
Poor Spike. He'll come around. He's genuinely a good little guy. 

155
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,080
Spike. What is this? 

156
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,710
You said this book was missing. Well, Owlowscious found it right where it belongs, but like this. 

157
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,300
How did it get this way?

158
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:42,270
Well, um... You see, I... I just didn't wanna disappoint you and...

159
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,490
Have you ever seen a dragon sneeze?

160
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:49,020
I've seen a dragon lie. I'm very disappointed in you, Spike.

161
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,840
You set me up! Well, two can play that game.

162
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,270
Not "who"! Two! 

163
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:08,100
Owlowscious is out to take my place, I just know it! I've gotta stop him. But how?

164
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,560
Come along, Opal. Let's hurry up and get to Fluttershy's tea party.

165
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,490
So lifelike. 

166
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:57,510
And when Twilight discovers it shredded up on her floor, she'll think mouse-eating Owlowscious is to blame. 

167
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,800
And I'll be number one... again!

168
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,600
That poor little field mouse! Torn to pieces! 

169
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,300
It must have been Owlowscious! You know, since owls eat, you know, mice. 

170
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,630
What a terrible, terrible bird! He must be punished! Right?

171
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,990
Spike! I don't know what upsets me more. 

172
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:08,530
That you deliberately tried to set up Owloysius or that you actually thought this pathetic attempt would work! 

173
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:13,150
You've let your jealousy get the best of you, Spike. I am truly disappointed. 

174
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,510
This is NOT the Spike I know and love.

175
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,530
She... She doesn't love me anymore. 

176
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,850
Twilight hates me. 

177
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:38,400
I'm cold, hungry, tired and lonely. Could it get any worse? 

178
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,280
I guess that's a yes.

179
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,550
Hello? 

180
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,950
Hello? 

181
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,650
What is that?

182
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:14,170
If this is what running away is all about, I never wanna go home!

183
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,510
 Gems! 

184
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,760
Even if my tummy's full, the rest of me is still empty. 

185
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,760
I miss Twilight and the pony gang. 

186
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:36,400
But she doesn't love me anymore. So, I'm better off here, all by myself. 

187
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,800
Wow. Seems to be getting warmer. 

188
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,990
The steam is great for my complexion, but it's sure getting hot in here.

189
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,980
What are you doing in my cave?

190
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,990
And why are you eating my gems?

191
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,100
Heyah bro! I didn't know this was your cave. 

192
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,300
And I didn't know these were your gems, but... we're cool, right?

193
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,630
We're like brothers, you know? I mean, you're a dragon, I'm a dragon... 

194
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,750
It's us against the world, right?

195
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,630
You don't scare me! So you're big. 

196
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,420
Really big. 

197
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,130
And your claws are super sharp. 

198
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,710
Tail... extra spiky. 

199
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,120
But, uh... You don't scare me! 

200
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,370
How'd you like that? 

201
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,200
I'd love to stay, but gotta go! See ya!

202
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,690
Spike! Over here!

203
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,490
Am I glad to see you!

204
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,490
Hurry! Hop on! 

205
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,600
It's too dark! I can't see!

206
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:11,920
Spike. We were so worried about you. I was so worried about you. 

207
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,760
Why did you run away?

208
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,540
I thought you didn't need me anymore. And that you didn't love me anymore.

209
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:24,200
Spike. Sure, I was disappointed, but you are my number one assistant! 

210
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,370
And friend. And you always will be. 

211
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,470
It's just that sometimes I need some help at night. I can't ask you to stay up late. 

212
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,510
You're a baby dragon and you need your rest. 

213
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:41,440
Owls are nocturnal. So I asked Owlowscious to help. But not to take your place. 

214
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:47,900
No one could ever replace you, Spike. Not even when you are being a jealous numbskull.

215
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,040
I'm sorry, Twilight. I've never should have been so jealous.

216
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,440
And I'm sorry too, Spike. I should have been more sensitive.

217
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:02,000
And Owlowscious... I know now that you weren't out to take my job.

218
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,820
 Forgive me?

219
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,570
Me. Forgive me, Spike.

220
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,010
He forgives you, Spike.

221
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,680
Hey! How did you guys know where I was?

222
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,710
It was your ketchup covered feet. 

223
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,210
Owlowscious discovered your footprints and we followed them all the way to the cave.

224
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,220
Oh yeah, the ketchup. It looked pretty real though, didn't it?

225
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,540
I know Princess Celestia will wanna read about what happened today...

226
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,310
I'm ready when you are.

227
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:42,790
Hey, Spike. Why don't you write to Princess Celestia? And tell her what you've learned?

228
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:46,540
Really? Why, that's a big responsibility!

229
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,240
I know. But nothing my number one assistant can't handle.

230
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,420
Dear Princess Celestia, this is Spike, writing to you about my adventures. 

231
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:01,110
This week I've learned that being jealous and telling lies gets you nowhere in friendship. 

232
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,210
I also learned that there's plenty of love for every friend to share. 

233
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:10,090
So from here on out, I promise, that I, Spike, will... 

234
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,030
Oh, Spike.

235
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,980
Who? Spike! You kno...
