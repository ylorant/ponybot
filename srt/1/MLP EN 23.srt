1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:08,930
Are you sure about this, Scootaloo? I've never even heard of a pony zip-lining before.

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,700
Neither have I, but Spike told me it was awesome!

3
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,990
See anything?

4
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,440
Tree sap and pine needles, but no cutie mark.

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,440
Plan B?

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,720
Yeah. You know where we can find a cannon at this hour?

7
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,110
It's no use! No matter what we try, we always end up without our cutie marks.

8
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,330
And, surprisingly often, covered in tree sap.

9
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:59,800
Maybe we should do something less dangerous? Like pillow testing. Or flower sniffing.

10
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,710
This town is full of ponies who have their cutie marks. Why don't we ask them how they did it?

11
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,280
That's a great safe idea.

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,260
Yeah! And we can start with the coolest pony in Ponyville.

13
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,230
- Applejack!
- Rarity!

14
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,830
Come on, guys, I said "cool"! You know who I'm talking about.

15
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,630
She's fast. She's tough. She's not afraid of anything!

16
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,740
Pinkie Pie?

17
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,480
No! The greatest flyer ever to come out of Cloudsdale.

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,010
Fluttershy?

19
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,510
No. Rainbow Dash!

20
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,170
Oh! Yeah, that makes much more sense.

21
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,370
Of course!

22
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,860
Let's do it. Let's find out how Rainbow Dash found her cutie mark!

23
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,050
Yeah!

24
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,550
Get back here, you thievin' varmints!

25
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,160
Thievin' what now?

26
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,460
Apple Bloom?

27
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,330
Hey sis! How'd you get your cutie mark?

28
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,380
I never told you that story?

29
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,020
Hey! I thought we were gonna ask Rainbow Dash.

30
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,790
We need all the help we can get.

31
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,420
Ugh! Fine.

32
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,810
Why, shoot. I was just a little filly. Even littler than y'all.

33
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,360
I didn't want to spend my life at a muddy old apple farm.

34
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,160
I wanted to live the sophisticated life, like my Aunt n' Uncle Orange.

35
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,830
So I set out to try my luck in a big city.

36
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,370
Manehattan! The most cosmopolitan city in all of Equestria.

37
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,980
Hey! Outta the way, you rude!

38
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,750
I knew I'd find out who I was meant to be in Manehattan.

39
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,470
Aunt Orange! Uncle Orange! Thank y'all so much for lettin' me stay!

40
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,120
"Y'all". Ahahaha... Isn't she just the living end?

41
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,850
How quaint.

42
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,500
Don't worry. We'll have you acting like a true Manehattanite in no time.

43
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,520
And how are you finding good old Manehattan?

44
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,790
Oh, it's simply divine.

45
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,770
Very well said, my dear.

46
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,600
Although, I must admit the city noise took some getting used to.

47
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,660
Where I'm from, nights are so quiet you seldom hear a peep until the roosters wake you.

48
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,110
The... what?

49
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,800
I say, my dear, what in the world is a "rooster"?

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,100
What's he talking about? What do I say? I don't wanna look like a fool.

51
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,850
Dinner is served.

52
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:30,180
Thank goodness. Being a city pony's hard work. I'm so hungry I could eat a...

53
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,770
Cock-a-doodle-doo...

54
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,680
Oh, I wonder what Granny Smith and Big Macintosh are up to.

55
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,790
I bet they're applebuckin' their way through the Red Delicious trees.

56
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,930
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just one bite...

57
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,500
I never felt so homesick in all my days as I did right then.

58
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,280
It was amazin'! A rainbow pointin' right back to... home.

59
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,770
In that moment, it all became clear. I knew right then just who I was supposed to be.

60
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,970
That's when this here appeared. I've been happily workin' in the farm ever since.

61
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,170
There they are! Get back here, ya thievin' varmints!

62
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,290
That was such a sweet story!

63
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,520
Sweet? Try sappy.

64
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,820
Come on! We've got to find Rainbow Dash and hear the cool way to get a cutie mark.

65
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,430
All right, little ones. This way. This way.

66
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,010
You really should be more careful. Somepony could get hurt.

67
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,330
Why are you in such a hurry anyway?

68
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,750
We're trying to find Rainbow Dash, so we can hear how she earned her cutie mark.

69
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,310
Oh, that would be interesting. You know, I wouldn't have gotten my cutie mark if it weren't for her.

70
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,500
Rainbow Dash?! Really?!

71
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,620
Oh yes. It all started at Summer Flight Camp.

72
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,270
You'd never guess, but when I was little I was very shy.

73
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,800
And a very weak flyer.

74
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,910
Nice going, "Cluttzershy"!

75
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,070
They outta ground you permanently.

76
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,000
HA! My baby brother can fly better than you!

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,200
It was the most humiliating moment of my life. And then, out of nowhere...

78
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,470
Leave her alone!

79
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,060
What are you gonna do, "Rainbow Crash"?

80
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,490
Keep making fun of her and find out!

81
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,590
You think you're such a big shot? Why don't you prove it?

82
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,590
Whaddya have in mind?

83
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,560
You're going down!

84
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,250
In history, maybe.

85
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,080
See you boys at the finish line!

86
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,450
I had never seen such beautiful creatures.

87
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:51,680
Butterflies don't fly as high as my cloud home. And I've never been near the ground before.

88
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:58,083
What is this place filled with so many wonders?

89
00:07:58,084 --> 00:08:02,844
Casting its spell that I am now under?

90
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,362
Squirrels in the trees and the cute little bunnies

91
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:12,189
Birds flying free and bees with their honey

92
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:18,130
Hooneeeeey!

93
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:24,070
Oooh, what a magical place and I owe it all to the pegasus race

94
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,064
If I knew the ground had so much up its sleeve

95
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:30,190
I'd have come here sooner, and never leave

96
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:39,810
Yes I Love Everythiiiiiiiiiing!

97
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,850
It's okay.

98
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,990
You can come out.

99
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,310
Everything's okay.

100
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,260
There's nothing to be afraid of.

101
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,970
Somehow I had the ability to communicate with the animals on a different level.

102
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,560
Wait, wait, wait. What happened to Rainbow Dash? What about the race?

103
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,400
Well, I wasn't there, so I don't really know what happened.

104
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,710
Come on, Crusaders. We've gotta find her.

105
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,330
Besides, I can't take any more singing.

106
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,990
Maybe my sister knows where she is.

107
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,900
Bye, Fluttershy!

108
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,900
Bye, girls!

109
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,540
How did we get roped into this?

110
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,090
We'll never hear Rainbow Dash's story.

111
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,160
Are you girls still obsessing over your cutie marks?

112
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,290
Of course!

113
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,640
Most other fillies at school already have theirs.

114
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,530
Mmm, I know how you feel. For the longest time I couldn't figure out why I didn't have mine.

115
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,440
Well done, Rarity. Your costumes are very nice.

116
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,640
Nice?! They need to be spectacular!

117
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,180
And the performance is tomorrow!

118
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,030
I tried every trick I could think of, but nothing seemed to work.

119
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:28,050
The costumes just weren't right. And the play opened that night!

120
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,750
Maybe I'm not meant to be a fashionista after all.

121
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,930
What's going on?!

122
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:43,670
I had no idea where my horn was taking me. But unicorn magic doesn't happen without a reason.

123
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:48,070
I knew this had to do with my love of fashion and maybe even my cutie mark!

124
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,750
I knew that this was...

125
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,130
MY DESTINY!

126
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,070
A ROCK?! That's my destiny?!

127
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,080
What is your problem, horn? I followed you all the way out here for a rock?!

128
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,560
Dumb rock!

129
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,360
These namby-pamby stories aren't getting us any closer to our cutie marks!

130
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,410
They're all about finding who you really are and boring stuff like that.

131
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,490
- Yes, Scootaloo, that's exactly...
- Come on, girls! We need action!

132
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,110
We need Rainbow Dash!

133
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:55,990
As a young filly in Canterlot, I always wanted to go to the Summer Sun Celebration, where Princess Celestia raises the sun.

134
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,810
And I saw the most amazing, most wonderful thing I've ever seen.

135
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,850
I poured myself into learning everything I could about magic.

136
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,850
My parents decided to enroll me in Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns.

137
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,760
It was a dream come true! Except for one thing...

138
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,420
I had to pass an entrance exam!

139
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,850
Well, Miss Sparkle?

140
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,050
Well, Miss Sparkle?

141
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,290
We don't have all day.

142
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,700
I knew this was the most important day of my life,

143
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,960
that my entire future would be affected by the outcome of this day.

144
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,200
And I was about to blow it!

145
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,970
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

146
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,910
Twilight Sparkle.

147
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,460
- I'm so sorry. I didn't mean...
- You have a very special gift.

148
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,580
I don't think I've ever come across a unicorn with your raw abilities.

149
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,470
But you need to learn to tame these abilities through focused study.

150
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:57,990
Twilight Sparkle, I'd like to make you my own personal protege here at the school.

151
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,870
Well?

152
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,220
YES!!!

153
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,970
One other thing, Twilight.

154
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,970
More?

155
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,830
My cutie mark!

156
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,060
Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes...

157
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,200
- OK, OK.
- We're happy for you, Twilight.

158
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,780
Yeah, thrilled. Let's get out of here while we still can.

159
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,300
Yes!

160
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,920
Are you okay?

161
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,680
Yes.

162
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,840
Why don't we ever smash into Rainbow Dash?!

163
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,840
You're looking for Rainbow Dash?

164
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,580
If I was her, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner.

165
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,420
Of course, if I was anyone, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner.

166
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,310
Hey! I have an idea! Wanna go to Sugarcube Corner?

167
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,220
Well, we're sort of looking for Rainbow Dash, so we can hear how she got her cutie mark.

168
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,410
Cutie mark? Come with me and I'll tell you how I got mine!

169
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,830
Why not?

170
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,450
Alright!

171
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,880
My sisters and I were raised on a rock farm outside of Ponyville.

172
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,840
We spent our days working the fields. There was no talking. There was no smiling.

173
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,870
There were only rocks.

174
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:25,190
We were in the south field, preparing to rotate the rocks to the east field when all of a sudden...

175
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:41,110
I never felt joy like that before. It felt so good I just wanted to keep smiling forever.

176
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,320
And I wanted everyone I knew to smile too,

177
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,840
but rainbows don't come along that often. I wondered, how else could I create some smiles?

178
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,910
We better harvest the rocks from the south field.

179
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,140
Pinkamina Diane Pie! Is that you?

180
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,930
Mom! I need you and dad and the sisters to come in. Quick!

181
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,070
Surprise!

182
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,090
You like it? It's called... a party!

183
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,550
Oh. You don't like it.

184
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,940
You like it!

185
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,580
I'm so happy!

186
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,320
And that's how Equestria was made.

187
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:49,011
Wha... huh?

188
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:50,620
Look! We're here!

189
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,670
Maybe on the way home I can tell you the story of how I got my cutie mark.

190
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,670
It's a gem!

191
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,870
Oh, come on. She's just being Pinkie Pie.

192
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,870
Rainbow Dash! You're here!

193
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,420
I hear you're looking for my cutie mark story?

194
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:16,040
You have no idea what I've been through today to hear that story.

195
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,350
It all happened during the race at Flight Camp,

196
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:24,070
where I stood alone against all odds to defend Fluttershy's honor.

197
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,070
I've never flown like THAT before. 

198
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,190
That freedom was unlike anything I've ever felt.

199
00:18:54,190 --> 00:19:00,690
The speed, the adrenaline, the wind in my mane... I liked it a lot.

200
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,490
Later, Rainbow Crash!

201
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,910
Turns out the only thing I liked more than flying fast...

202
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,880
was winning!

203
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,510
Most people thought that the Sonic Rainboom was just an old mare's tail.

204
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:29,170
But that day... The day I discovered racing... I proved that the legends were true.

205
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,150
I made the impossible happen!

206
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:47,310
And that, little ones, is how you earn a cutie mark.

207
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,720
Wait a second. I heard that explosion. And I saw the rainbow too.

208
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,920
Rainbow Dash, if you hadn't scared the animals,

209
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,110
I never would have learned I could communicate with them and gotten my cutie mark.

210
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,050
I heard that boom! And right afterwards there was this amazing rainbow that taught me to smile.

211
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,460
When I got my cutie mark, I saw a rainbow that pointed me home.

212
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,980
I bet it was your sonic rainboom!

213
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,700
There was an explosion I could never explain when I got my cutie mark.

214
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:19,270
This is uncanny! If that explosion didn't happen when it did, I would have blown my entrance exam.

215
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,200
Rainbow Dash, I think you helped me earn my cutie mark too!

216
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,410
We all owe our cutie marks to you!

217
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:32,610
Do you realize what this means? All of us had a special connection before we even met.

218
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,500
We've been BFFs forever and we didn't even know it!

219
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,160
Come here, y'all.

220
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,590
I love you, guys!

221
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,270
Gimme a break. Come on, Crusaders! Maybe we just need to try zip-lining again.

222
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,260
How about a song?

223
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,970
NOOOOO!

224
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,840
Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned something amazing.

225
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:10,840
Everypony everywhere has a special magical connection with her friends, maybe even before she's met them.

226
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,340
If you're feeling lonely and you're still searching for your true friends,

227
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,180
just look up in the sky.

228
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:22,010
Who knows? Maybe you and your future best friends are all looking at the same rainbow.

229
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,760
Gross! When did you get so cheesy?

230
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,940
Just write it, Spike.
