1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,760
Where are you takin' us?

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,470
We're almost there, youngin's.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,380
I've never been here before.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,720
- Oh. Sorry.
- Are we there yet?

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,130
There? Where? What? I don't even know what we're doing.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,460
Here we are.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,870
What are we lookin' at?

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,760
I have no idea.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,220
What is that thing?

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,050
Cutie Mark Crusaders, welcome to your new clubhouse.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,680
Well, don't thank me all at once. This was my clubhouse when I was your age.

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,970
Sure it hasn't been used in a while, but it's empty and on a secluded, private part of the farm.

13
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,360
And it's all yours. It just needs a little, uh... TLC.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,080
TLC as in Tender Loving Care or Totally Lost Cause?

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,520
Applejack! We're supposed to turn this into our new clubhouse?

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, maybe y'all will get your cutie marks when you discover your talent for...

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,540
House cleanin'?

18
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,420
Not so fast!

19
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,020
Hi, Scootaloo! Back already? You're amazin' on that scooter.

20
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,060
Thanks! Wow, Apple Bloom. You did all of this?

21
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,580
Yep! I've fixed the broken shutters, sanded off the splinters, rebuilt the roof, painted...

22
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,820
That's so cool. What's Sweetie Belle up to?

23
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,280
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders...

24
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,620
...never stop the journey...

25
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:14,300
There you are, Sweetie Belle! See? I told you we could find her by following her totally awesome voice.

26
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,350
What's that sweet tune you're singing?

27
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,570
I was just working on our new Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song.

28
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,260
Cool!

29
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,500
Teach us?

30
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,320
Well, I've only come up with one part... but okay!

31
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,497
They all say that you will get your mark

32
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:35,361
When the time is really right

33
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:39,263
And you know just what you're supposed to do

34
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:42,832
And your talent comes to light!

35
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,180
Well, uh... I'll be, Cutie Mark Crusaders. You've done one fine job with this place.

36
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,820
So, what's next?

37
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,360
Well, now that we have a real life clubhouse...

38
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,140
And a map of Ponyville.

39
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,620
And a Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song.

40
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,840
Theme song?

41
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,390
We're gonna go out in the world and discover our talents.

42
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,860
- A new adventure!
- And earn our cutie marks.

43
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,630
We'll leave no stone unturned!

44
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,600
No mountain unclimbed!

45
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,280
No meal uncooked!

46
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,810
No song unlearned!

47
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,760
Well okay then! Sounds like you have a plan.

48
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,870
I gotta, uh... Leave no apple unpicked! See y'all later!

49
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,360
Are we ready to get our cutie marks, ponies?

50
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,960
Ready!

51
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,610
- I had nothing to do with this.
- What is going on here?

52
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,690
Well, we sure aren't gettin' our cutie marks for bein' librarians.

53
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,830
I should think not.

54
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,790
What?

55
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,610
Girls, I think you're going about this the wrong way.

56
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:40,130
Instead of trying to do things in areas you're not familiar with, why not try doing things in areas that you already like?

57
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,010
And I have the perfect place to start.

58
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,550
- "Showcase your talents...
- for all to see...

59
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,500
Perform in the Ponyville school talent show."

60
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,790
There'll be all sorts of awards. Best dramatic performance, best comedy act, best magic act...

61
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,130
Surely you can find your talent.

62
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,060
This would be the perfect place to discover our talents.

63
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,910
- Jugglin'!
- Acting!
- Magic tricks!

64
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,240
- Square dancin'!
- Tightrope walking!
- Tiger taming!

65
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,260
My little ponies! You're missing the point.

66
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,160
Think about the things you already enjoy doing. Think about what you're already good at.

67
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,050
Sure! We can do that.

68
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,570
Yeah! Sure we can.

69
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,410
Well, whatever we do, we'll do it as...

70
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,300
The Cutie Mark Crusaders!

71
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:36,550
Sweetie Belle! I told you not to touch my things. Come back with my supplies!

72
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:42,350
We're just borrowing them for the talent show. Don't worry, sis. I promise we'll bring them back.

73
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:48,480
Thanks, Mr. Breezy. We'll return the fan to you real soon.

74
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,300
What do we need this fan for?

75
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
Trust me on this one.

76
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,050
Okay, so that's six wooden planks, four-by-eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint and four brushes.

77
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,590
Anything else?

78
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:10,480
Yeah. Instructions on how to use six wooden planks, four-by-eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint and four brushes.

79
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,760
"Ghost, Goblins and Ghoulish Figures"? Good heavens, girls. What do you need a book like this for?

80
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,240
You'll see. Thanks, Twilight. We'll give it back as soon as we're done with it.

81
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,930
What do you think they're up to?

82
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,200
I have no idea and I don't know if I should be excited or scared to find out.

83
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,570
I'm glad we're doin' this as a team.

84
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,830
Me too.

85
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,300
Um... so what are we doing again?

86
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,180
A super awesome dramatic song for the talent show, of course.

87
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,410
Right! With super-cool scenery. And amazing costumes!

88
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,700
And mind-blowin' dance moves.

89
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,100
This is gonna be soo amazing!

90
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,890
Sweetie Belle, I think you should be the singer.

91
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:59,480
What? No way I'm singing in front of a crowd. Twilight said to do something we like to do,

92
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,720
and I'd like to be like my big sister, and she's a designer.

93
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,320
Fine then. You can do the costumes and the scenery.

94
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,430
And Scootaloo, you're great in maneuvers on your scooter. So you should do the choreography.

95
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,860
Y'know, all those dance moves.

96
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,120
Nah. I'd rather sing a wicked rock ballad.

97
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,460
Why don't you come up with the dance routine, Apple Bloom?

98
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,630
I'm not much of a dancer... but I do like Kung-fu. That's kinda like dancin'.

99
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,230
Then it's settled! Let's get started.

100
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,460
One... two... three...

101
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,940
Ow, Apple Bloom! What are you doing?

102
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,380
I feel like I have four left feet. I can't even spin right.

103
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,370
Don't be silly. You just gotta keep your head forward until very the last minute, like this.

104
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,670
See? Easy-peasy. You just gotta practice a bunch, that's all.

105
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,170
That does look easy. Thanks.

106
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,220
Okay. Let's try this again.

107
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,280
I'm okay!

108
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,240
- Keep practicing!
- Will do.

109
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:36,690
We fight the fight, walk the walk. Talk the talk, eat the... uh... food like a celery stalk?

110
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,890
I'll never come up with anything!

111
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,370
Never, never, never!

112
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,830
Come back! Come back!

113
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,500
Dumb fabric.

114
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,930
Hey Scoot! How's the song going?

115
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,080
Oh my! Sounds serious.

116
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,050
I'm just no good at lyrics. Coming up with words is, like... really hard.

117
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,390
Oh, it can't be that bad.

118
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:13,240
"With our cutie marks we'll rock Equestria. We use our stomachs to... digestia"?

119
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,530
Well... These are... um... good, but...

120
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,110
How about after "We fight the fight"...

121
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,530
There is nothing that we fear

122
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:29,704
We'll have to figure out what we'll do next

123
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:33,587
Till our cutie marks are here

124
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,380
Wow! That's so awesome! Did you just come up with that now?

125
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,500
Yeah... kind of.

126
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,180
Thanks, I'm totally using that.

127
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,810
Oh no!

128
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,170
One, two, three, four, FIVE?!

129
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,650
How's the spin coming along?

130
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,440
I think I gotta just stick to punches and kicks.

131
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,180
You know, ponies only have four legs.

132
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,280
I'll never be a designer like my sister Rarity.

133
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,050
Hey, it's no big deal. Why don't you use the dress form?

134
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,820
It'll help you with your patterns and help you put all the pieces in the right places.

135
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,930
Oh, is that what that's for?

136
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,140
Maybe you should also clean your paintbrush between each color.aybe you should also clean your paintbrush between each color.

137
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,750
Oh, I was wondering why all the colors looked like mud.

138
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,080
You're not using power tools, are you?

139
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,060
The talent show is just around the corner. I wonder how the fillies are doin'.

140
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,210
- Sorry, Scootaloo.
- That's okay.

141
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,040
- Sorry, Scootaloo.
- Oh, my bad, Sweetie Belle.

142
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,490
Let's sing the chorus again!

143
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,530
Well, gosh. Sure wasn't expectin' that.

144
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,630
I think that sounded pretty good.

145
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,910
Me too. You think we're ready?

146
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,030
Ready as we'll ever be.

147
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,560
Hey! Did you see us practicing?

148
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,340
Uh... Yeah.

149
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,640
Well? How'd we do? How'd we do?

150
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,990
Speechless! See, girls? I told you that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna leave them speechless.

151
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,260
"Speechless" is right.

152
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:54,360
..and on the count of three this rabbit will disappear and something tasty will reappear in its place.

153
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,760
A one, a two and a three!

154
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,690
Hey! Where are they?

155
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,660
Snails, where are the...

156
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,520
carrots.

157
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,510
Snails!

158
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,730
Uh, how about a round of applause for the S&S magic act?

159
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:21,870
Now for our next act we have Sunny Days and Peachy Pie reciting their favorite poem... on rollerskates!

160
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,840
Break a leg!

161
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,480
Sweetie Belle! What a thing to say!

162
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,530
No, no, no. You see, in the theater it's considered bad luck to say "good luck".

163
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,630
So you say "break a leg" instead.

164
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,380
My little ponies! How are you doing?

165
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,230
Nervous...

166
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,620
Don't worry. You're gonna be amazing. Remember, just stick to what you know best.

167
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,050
I can't wait to hear you sing, Sweetie Belle.

168
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,380
Why does everypony always think I'm gonna sing?

169
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,200
Actually, Twilight Sparkle, I'm the main singer tonight.

170
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,800
And I'm the main dancer.

171
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,970
- And I'm in charge of...
- Costumes?

172
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,810
And sets and props. How'd you know?

173
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,910
Really, girls? Are you sure...

174
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,250
Cutie Mark Crusaders, you're on next. Break a leg.

175
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,650
Break a le...

176
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,500
Good luck!

177
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,747
Look, here are three little ponies

178
00:16:24,748 --> 00:16:28,326
Ready to sing for this crowd

179
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,901
Listen up, 'cause here's our story

180
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:36,509
I'm gonna sing it... very loud!

181
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,571
When you're a younger pony

182
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:50,132
And your flank is very bare

183
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,134
Feels like the sun will never come

184
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:57,321
When your cutie mark's not there

185
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,689
So the three of us fight the fight

186
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:04,801
There is nothing that we fear

187
00:17:04,836 --> 00:17:08,626
We'll have to figure out what we'll do next

188
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:12,575
Till our cutie marks are here

189
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,724
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders

190
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:19,882
On a quest to find out who we are

191
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,005
And we will never stop the journey

192
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:27,554
Not until we have our cutie marks

193
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,522
They all say that you'll get your mark

194
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:41,320
When the time is really right

195
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,076
And you know just what you're supposed to do

196
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:48,582
And your talent comes to light

197
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,969
But it's not as easy as it sounds

198
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,650
And that waiting's hard to do

199
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,618
So we test our talents everywhere

200
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:03,105
Until our face is blue

201
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,827
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders

202
00:18:07,828 --> 00:18:10,847
On a quest to find out who we are

203
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,984
And we will never stop the journey

204
00:18:14,985 --> 00:18:17,999
Not until we have our cutie marks

205
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:22,121
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders

206
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:25,378
On a quest to find out who we are

207
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,182
And we will never stop the journey

208
00:18:29,183 --> 00:18:33,178
Not until we have our cutie marks!

209
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,790
Wow. That did not go as well as I expected.

210
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,370
I can't believe they're laughin' at us.

211
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,730
Was it that bad?

212
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,000
Back on stage, girls. It's time for the awards.

213
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,590
Back on stage? No.

214
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,600
They'll just laugh some more.

215
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,650
Yeah, what's the point?

216
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:14,330
Now girls, let's be good sports. You made a great effort. You should be proud. Now come on!

217
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,990
Let's hear it for all our talented fillies and colts.

218
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:26,980
Our first award goes to... Snips and Snails for best magic act.

219
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,020
Mine's at least shinier.

220
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,100
Well, mine's bigger.

221
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,520
Oh yeah, well... Well, mine is, um... heavier?

222
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:45,450
The next award goes to... Sunny Days and Peachy Pie for best dramatic performance.

223
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:51,470
And finally, the last award of the night goes to...

224
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,150
The Cutie Mark Crusaders!

225
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,420
What?

226
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,960
For best comedy act.

227
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,000
Can you believe it? We won!

228
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,020
I knew our act was awesome.

229
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:24,150
You know what would be the best? If we won and we got our cutie marks.

230
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,490
Congratulations, ponies! Job well done.

231
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,820
Thanks, Twilight.

232
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,340
Hey, you don't sound too excited.

233
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:45,300
We worked really hard and won a prize but we still don't have our cutie marks.

234
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,270
Which is the prize we really wanted.

235
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,410
Oh, girls...

236
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,050
But we think we know why.

237
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,980
Yes. We know why.

238
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,300
Oh? Tell me. I'd love to make a special report to the Princess.

239
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,370
Well, maybe we were trying too hard?

240
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,280
Yes? And...

241
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,170
And instead of forcing ourselves to do something that's not meant for us...

242
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,090
Yes? Yes?

243
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,070
We each should be embracing our true talent!

244
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,070
And that is...?

245
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,530
Comedy!

246
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,720
Apple Bloom! You did it!

247
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,100
Did you see our award? Weren't we funny?

248
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,290
One day... One day...
