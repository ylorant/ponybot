1
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,867
Perfect!

2
00:00:13,116 --> 00:00:19,699
Coming! Welcome to Carousel Boutique, where every garment is chic, unique and magnifique.

3
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,615
Sapphire Shores! The Pony of Pop!

4
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:27,747
Good afternoon, miss Raritee!

5
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:30,834
You know my name?

6
00:00:30,835 --> 00:00:39,478
Well, of course I do, darling. I make it a point to know all of the up-and-coming designers and Clothes Horse magazine simply raved about you.

7
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:45,973
Oh my stars. If I'm dreaming, do not wake me up. How may I help you, Miss Shores?

8
00:00:45,974 --> 00:00:48,817
Oh please, call me Sapphire.

9
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:52,291
How may I help you, Sapphire?

10
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:59,958
Well, as I'm sure you know, I'll be touring all of Equestria with my latest concert, SAPPHIRE SHORES ZIGFILLY FOLLIES

11
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:05,439
so I need to look SEEENSATIONAL! OW!

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,636
I have just what you need. Sapphire Shores, prepare yourself for the "pièce de résistance de la haute couture".

13
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,608
I used every last diamond I found on this one garment.

14
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:23,129
And it is spectacular! I'll take it.

15
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,230
Really?

16
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:28,058
Oh yes, and five more, each done up in a different jewel.

17
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,803
Beg pardon?

18
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:31,304
Costume changes.

19
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:38,170
Yes, I do have that effect on ponies.

20
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:24,326
Oh my gosh! Sapphire Shores! the Pony of Pop! She is awesome! I mean, she's gorgeous, talented and-heh

21
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:31,085
...and not even half the pony you are. I mean, you're ten times more gorgeous and talented and...

22
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:33,847
Spike, a lady is never jealous.

23
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:37,320
Eh, of course not. But were you totally flipping out or what?!

24
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:42,783
Ladies do not "flip out", Spike. However, I was quite in awe.

25
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:47,686
I need to find more jewels than ever before to decorate her costumes. 

26
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:54,172
- Did you find some?
- Yes, Spike! Right there!

27
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:07,707
Oooooh! 
You look so delicious...

28
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:13,651
Spike! 
I promised I'll give you gems to snack on.

29
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:18,132
But we need to collect more first or I'll never be able to make these outfits for Sapphire.

30
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:22,473
Hm... I will miss you, my sweets.

31
00:03:22,674 --> 00:03:25,687
Come along, Spike. We have many jewels to find.

32
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:27,338
At your service, my lady.

33
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,374
Spike!

34
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:08,649
You've been very patient today, Spike. And for that you'll get the finest reward. 

35
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:11,369
This is from me to you.

36
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,674
Is something wrong, Spike?

37
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,347
No. It's perfect.

38
00:04:22,698 --> 00:04:26,314
Oh, bring the cart, Spike. There are more over here.

39
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:29,894
For me. From Rarity.

40
00:04:32,507 --> 00:04:49,163
Yesss, gemsss. Gemsss! Our preciousss gemsss! He is the gem hunter. With him we can have all those gems. And more! Let's get the dragon.

41
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,464
Spike! Where are you?

42
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:51,565
What? Who is that?

43
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:55,315
You know, it's terrible to keep a lady waiting.

44
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:57,652
Coming!

45
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:03,836
I think we're really going to strike gold this time. So to speak.

46
00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:06,126
Jackpot!

47
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:11,066
Oh, it's not the dragon we want. It's the pony!

48
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:19,126
Well, Spike, I think that's all we can do for today. And these will certainly get me well on my way with Sapphire's outfits. 

49
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:23,193
Why don't we start headi... Oh! What's this? Another jewel.

50
00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:26,367
Oh, strange. It's in the trees. 

51
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,780
Good day, gentle... uh, fellow.

52
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:35,913
I am Rarity and this is my friend Spike.

53
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,726
And you are...

54
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:40,655
A diamond dog.

55
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:44,340
Oh really? Oh well, that explains your fine taste in jewelry. 

56
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:50,351
I mean I-I know diamonds are a girl's best friend and now I know they're a dog's best friend too, ha ha ha.

57
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:53,607
So, um, are you out hunting for gems as well?

58
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:55,971
Yes. We hunt.

59
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:57,172
Uh... we?

60
00:05:57,173 --> 00:06:04,487
We hunt for gems. But you are a better hunter. So now we hunt... for you!

61
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:13,906
Run, Rarity! Run!

62
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:25,077
- Spike! Come on! Hurry!
- Gotcha!

63
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,588
Got him, Rarity! I got him!

64
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:31,612
Haha! Nope!

65
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:34,508
Sorry, scaly one.

66
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:36,349
Wait! Rarity?

67
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,206
Unhand me this instant, you ruffians. Stop! Put me down, you scum! You rough-!

68
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:43,172
Rarity!

69
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:47,839
Spike! Ah, dirt! AAAAAH, SPIKE!

70
00:06:48,904 --> 00:06:51,099
SAVE ME...!

71
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,534
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

72
00:06:58,742 --> 00:07:01,130
Spike, can you breathe now?

73
00:07:02,018 --> 00:07:04,759
Yes... I think so.

74
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,677
Good. Now tell us what you know.

75
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:09,051
Yeah. Cause all you said earlier was...

76
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:13,388
Aaaah! Rarity... woods... jewels... dogs... hole... taken... SAVE HER!

77
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:16,789
Not a whole lot to go on there, Sport.

78
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,906
Sorry. Rarity and I were in the woods looking for jewels when these creepy guys showed up.

79
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:21,907
Creepy guys?

80
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:26,779
They called themselves the diamond dogs. They grabbed Rarity and disappeared down a hole in the ground.

81
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,035
Well, that sounds mighty easy. Just take us to that their hole and we'll save Rarity.

82
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:37,551
Holy Moly, that's a lotta holeys.

83
00:07:37,552 --> 00:07:40,128
Come on, girls! Let's get started.

84
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,737
Hello!

85
00:08:00,456 --> 00:08:03,400
Quick! We gotta get down one before they're all filled up.

86
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:07,674
Oh! Oh my. Oh, oh!

87
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:20,155
We can't muscle through it!

88
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,095
We'll see about that.

89
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:37,004
Huh. Heavens to Betsy. Now I'm used to pickin' myself up and dustin' myself off but Rarity won't even touch mud 'less it's imported.

90
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:38,205
Oh, Rarity...

91
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:46,806
Oh, woe is me! What ever shall I do? 

92
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:54,253
Ah! Dirt, dirt! Get away, dirt! Oh! Make it stop, make it stop!

93
00:08:54,254 --> 00:09:02,768
Ah! Filthy, disgusting dirt. It stings, it burns. Help! Oh, somepony save me, SAVE ME!

94
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:05,360
We gotta save her.

95
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:07,578
But they blocked up all the holes.

96
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:11,137
Don't mean we can't dig 'em out. Come on!

97
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,624
Get 'em!

98
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:03,250
Oh, those scary monsters popping up everywhere. Oh, poor Rarity must be terrified.

99
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:07,451
Get me the baubles!

100
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:08,852
Get me the beads!

101
00:10:09,097 --> 00:10:10,505
Get me the trinkets!

102
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:12,536
Where is the treasure?!

103
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:17,368
Poor Rarity. What are we gonna do?

104
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:22,280
I got it! I'll save you, my sweet.

105
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:24,637
Huh?

106
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,857
Spike, it is very noble of you...

107
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:35,055
...to sacrifice the gem Rarity gave you.

108
00:10:35,056 --> 00:10:38,678
Oh, Lady Rarity. My damsel in distress.

109
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,955
I shall save you. Show yourselves, you dogs! You curse! 

110
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:48,116
Hah. There you are, you mingy mutts.

111
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:52,146
Who are you calling mutts? Unleash the hounds!

112
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:31,504
Now, where is Lady Rarity?

113
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:41,119
Oh, Spike! I knew you would save me!

114
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,055
Nothing could stop me, my lady.

115
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:47,876
Oho, Spike. You are my... hero.

116
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:57,111
Hoho there, lover boy.

117
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:02,761
I got a bite! I got a bite!

118
00:12:03,094 --> 00:12:04,634
Hold on there, little fella.

119
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:06,196
Applejack!

120
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,409
Twilight!

121
00:12:09,748 --> 00:12:11,574
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness...

122
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:14,656
Wait for me! Wheee!

123
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:35,487
Ha ha, it worked! We're in! Now we can finally save Rarity!

124
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:38,779
Um... Which way do we go?

125
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:45,399
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

126
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:50,371
All these tunnels... How are we ever gonna find Rarity?

127
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:53,195
Guess we're just gonna have to start going down them one by one.

128
00:12:53,196 --> 00:12:56,542
That could take forever! There's gotta be way to narrow it down.

129
00:12:56,543 --> 00:13:00,208
I know! I bet they've taken Rarity down the tunnel with the most gems.

130
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:04,122
But Spike, Rarity is the only one who knows how to find gems.

131
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:08,478
No, Twilight. You can! You can copy Rarity's gemfinding spell.

132
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:14,813
Oh my gosh! You're right! Rarity showed me how she did it a while back. If I can just remember...

133
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:23,824
That's it. You did it, Twilight. Come on! 

134
00:13:24,963 --> 00:13:28,401
We're coming, Rarity. We'll save you. Just hold on.

135
00:13:28,802 --> 00:13:32,093
Oh please, diamond dogs. Please let me go.

136
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:32,894
No!

137
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,412
You're our precious little pony.

138
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:37,979
For ever! Muhahahaha.

139
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,343
But what ever do you want from me?

140
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:41,444
Gemsss!

141
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,427
Yes! The gems. The jewels.

142
00:13:44,428 --> 00:13:48,446
- Find them! Find them all!
- Oh! Is that all?

143
00:13:54,077 --> 00:13:58,955
There. A lovely pocket of jewels are right there. Now, would you be so kind as to show me the exit?

144
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:04,691
Good! Now, dig them up, pony.

145
00:14:04,692 --> 00:14:08,487
What? But you said you wanted me to find the gems.

146
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:10,992
Yes! Find and then dig.

147
00:14:10,993 --> 00:14:14,197
- Dig?
- Yes. Dig.

148
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:31,806
What are you doing? We said dig!

149
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:40,638
Forgive me but prior to you so rudely dragging me into your dirt pit, I had a pony pedi and I am not about to chip a hoof because you dislike my style of digging.

150
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:52,466
Oh, for goodness. Fine! Just stop. Stop! Dig, dogs! Dig! And fast.

151
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,596
She won't dig, she pulls.

152
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:02,129
I beg your pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing?

153
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,655
Others will dig. You will haul the wagon.

154
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:09,189
Prrrecious pony pedi will be preserved.

155
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,964
Well, somebody certainly needs proper nail care.

156
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:16,294
When was the last time you two had a manicure? You're scratching up my coat with that jagged things.

157
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:18,694
Please be quiet!

158
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:21,926
Good heavens, what is that smell?

159
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:24,766
Smeeeeeell?

160
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:27,278
Ah, mystery solved. It's your breath.

161
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:35,248
Enough! Search, pony!

162
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:37,874
Well, since you insist...

163
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:41,307
But I must say the working conditions in here are simply dreadful.

164
00:15:42,012 --> 00:15:46,840
Musty and damp, it's going to wreak havoc on my mane. And this air is strictly suffocating.

165
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:51,069
And when I try to get a deep breath, the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseating. 

166
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:56,868
You look and smell like if you haven't bathed in weeks. Have you never heard of soap? 

167
00:15:57,693 --> 00:15:59,890
You could all do with a good round of soap and water.

168
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:03,586
Water, water, I'm terribly thirsty. Could I please have some water?

169
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:08,341
Good gracious, I can't take this anymore. BE QUIET, PONY!

170
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:12,638
And that's another thing. I would appreciate if you stopped calling me "pony".

171
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:19,396
I am a lady and I wish to be addressed as such. So you may call me "Miss" or "Rarity" or "Miss Rarity".

172
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:23,627
Enough! Your whining! It hurts!

173
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:27,233
Whining? I am not whining. I am complaining. 

174
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:30,736
Do you want to hear whining? Thiiis iiis whiiining!

175
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:34,498
Oooh, this harness it too tiiight! It's going to chafe.

176
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:38,971
Can't you loosen it? Oooh, it hurts and it's sooo ruuusty! 

177
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:42,659
Why didn't you clean it first? It's gonna leave a staaain!

178
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,539
And the wagon's getting heeeavy, why do I have to pull it?!

179
00:16:46,844 --> 00:16:47,608
Make it stop!

180
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:49,664
Stop whining!

181
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:53,395
But I thought you wanted whiiining!

182
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:56,327
We'll do anything, pony!

183
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:02,428
Oh, uh, we'll do anything, "Miss Rarity".

184
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,912
Anything?

185
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:16,450
Oh, this water is hardly sparkling. But I suppose it will have to do.

186
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:24,364
Wait! Why are we doing this?

187
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:29,330
To stop the awful noises from the pony's mouth, remember?

188
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:39,066
Yes, yes, I know. This is ridiculous! Letting a pony order us around. What are we? Mice or dogs?

189
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:40,956
Mi... dogs?

190
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,225
Dogs do not pull. Ponies pull. Let her make the awful noises.

191
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:55,728
What are you doing? Hey, you spilled my drink. Oh! Not sooo tiiight!

192
00:17:55,729 --> 00:18:01,205
Ha! Make the noises all you want. But move while you make them. Hyah, mule!

193
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:05,957
Did you just call me a... mule?

194
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:13,602
Mules are ugly. Are you saying that I too am ugly?

195
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:19,176
What are these noises?

196
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:22,234
HE CALLED ME UGLY!

197
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,803
No! Mule! I said mule!

198
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:34,268
An old ugly mule! And it's true! Just look at me. I used to be beautiful, but nooow...

199
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:38,495
No, no! You're still beautiful, po... uh, Miss Rarity.

200
00:18:38,496 --> 00:18:41,348
You're just saying that!

201
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:43,495
No, you're still pretty and... and...

202
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:45,608
Oh, uh uh, nice. Yeah.

203
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:50,766
I don't believe you! You never liked me! 

204
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,275
I have just about enough of this.

205
00:19:02,177 --> 00:19:04,781
We're getting close. I can feel it.

206
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:09,833
It's coming from down here. Come on!

207
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,113
She must be in there. Let's go!

208
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:18,308
More workhorses.

209
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:25,041
Ho, doggies. If you can take this bull by the horns, you better be ready for a ride.

210
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:30,454
Come on, ponies! Kick 'em up, kick 'em out. Buck 'em up, buck 'em down.

211
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:41,219
Yeehaw! Get along, little doggies!

212
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:52,626
I'm coming for you, my lady. Hi-ho, Twilight! Away!

213
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:55,616
And just what do you think you're doing?

214
00:19:55,617 --> 00:19:58,030
Please, Twilight. Just give me this.

215
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,750
Eh... fine.

216
00:20:04,153 --> 00:20:07,115
Lady Rarity, I'm here to save you!

217
00:20:07,116 --> 00:20:10,447
Please, take us! Make it Stop! Please!

218
00:20:10,448 --> 00:20:11,448
Excuse me?

219
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:12,545
So picky.

220
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:13,646
And critical.

221
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,015
She won't stop talking.

222
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:16,016
And crying.

223
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:18,608
We, uh, give her back. Yes.

224
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:21,260
Rarity! You're safe!

225
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:25,927
Why, yes. Hello, girls. You are just in time to assist me.

226
00:20:25,928 --> 00:20:27,866
Assist you with what?

227
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:29,307
With those.

228
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:36,793
You're letting us leave with all these... jewels?

229
00:20:36,794 --> 00:20:40,791
Yes. Take them. And her with them.

230
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:41,792
Please!

231
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,874
I can't believe you got all these gems!

232
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:53,056
Heh. I can't believe you tricked all those dogs.

233
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:57,505
Just because I'm a lady doesn't mean I cannot handle myself in a sticky situation.

234
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,553
I had them wrapped around my hoof the entire time.

235
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:04,384
I can't wait to write to Princess Celestia to tell her what you taught me today.

236
00:21:04,385 --> 00:21:06,833
Me? What did I teach you?

237
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:10,186
Just because somepony is ladylike doesn't make her weak. 

238
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:16,895
In fact, by using her wits a seemingly defenseless pony can be the one who outsmarts and outshines them all.

239
00:21:16,896 --> 00:21:22,602
Hm... "Outshines" is right. Now you have enough gems to cover Sapphire Shores'es costumes.

240
00:21:22,603 --> 00:21:25,221
Not if you eat them all, Spike.
